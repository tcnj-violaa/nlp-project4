this product is clearly not ready for prime time i don't care how cool it looks if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless	0
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears	0
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap  	0

this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other  	1
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white lowbudget original  	1
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down	0
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film  	1
