the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age  	1
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better	0

third the cheese on my friend's burger was cold	0
it was a drive to get there	0
this is a disgrace	0
i'm pleased	1
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted  	0
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	1
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended	1

 with great sound effects and impressive special effects i can't recommend this movie enough  	1
does not fit	0
good product good seller	1
and there wasn't a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here  	1
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far	1

paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal	0
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch	1
so good i am going to have to review this place twice  once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night	1
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up	1
the pleather case doesn't fit	0
he really didn't seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests  	0
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting  	1
the phone was unusable and was not new	0
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly	1
their chow mein is so good	1
service sucks	0
and none of the tones is acceptable	0
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking  	0
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably  	0
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere	1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored	1
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting	1
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table	1

these headphones were a great find  and i think they are perhaps the best purchase i've made in the last several years  seriously	1

everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good	1
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there	1
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real  	1

sprint charges for this service	0
i'm returning them	0
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh  	0
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre  	1

i cannot make calls at certain places	0
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie  	0
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with	0
 in fact it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself  	1
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them	1
unfortunately it did not work	0
the fries were great too	1
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say  it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things   	0
after all the rave reviews i couldn't wait to eat herewhat a disappointment	0
a standout scene  	1
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad	1
this game rocks  	1

up there with the best of melville  	1
the poor actors  	0

the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art  	1

i went on motorola's website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again	0
how stupid is that	0
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was  how it contained holes inconsistencies and  frankly  a whole lot of crap  and how horrid the dancing was  	0
we'll never go again	0

leopard print is wonderfully wild	1
this is such a fun and funny movie  	1

my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed  	1
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor	1
im in az all the time and now have my new spot	1
the story itself is just predictable and lazy  	0
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap  	0
definitely will come back here again	1
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds	0

the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone	0
go watch it  	1
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem	1
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks  	0
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  	1
everything about this film is simply incredible  	1
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing	0
we definately enjoyed ourselves	1
the sets are so bad they wouldn't look out of place on a thunderbirds episode  	0
poor voice clarity	0
really good product	1

but i thought his acting was skilled  	1
horrible phone	0

 down the drain because of a weak snap	0
the instruction manual is lacking	0
its not user friendly	0
voice quality signal strength dropped calls	0
i wasn't really impressed with strip steak	0
a good film by a great director  	1
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us	0
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games	0
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience  	1
i'm not really sure how joey's was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine	0
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time i'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago	1
the battery works great	1
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more  	0
crostini that came with the salad was stale	0
what the hell kind of crap is that  	0
 with great sound effects and impressive special effects i can't recommend this movie enough  	1
great phone	1
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced	1
maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible	0
wasted two hours  	0
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	0
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor pizza hut coupons	0
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill  	1
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular	1
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  	0
the best part about nurse betty is it's unpredictability  	1
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it	0
now i know that i made a wise decision	1
damn good steak	1
excellent product for the price	1
this is a beautiful phone	1
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives  	1
as for the mains also uninspired	0
i wasn't the least bit interested  	0
same evening him and i are both drastically sick	0
great product	1
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
hated it  	0
it was just too horrible  	0
iam very pleased with my purchase	1
what a mistake	0
i was deeply impressed with the character he played  	1
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard  	1

the service here leaves a lot to be desired	0
excellent dualpurpose headset	1
the battery is completely useless to me	0
this place is disgusting	0
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place	0
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away	1
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see  	1
cute quaint simple honest	1
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original  	0
always a great time at dos gringos	1
the igo chargers and tips are really great	1
the plot  well i said i'd let that one go  	0
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too  	0
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue  	0
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas	1
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone	0
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever	0
totally believable  	1
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  	1
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place	1
these are fabulous	1
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  	0
the desserts were a bit strange	0
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  	1
this isn't a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment	1
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old  	1
waste of money	0
no buyers remorse on this one	0
it was quite comfortable in the ear	1
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design	0
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off	0
i'll be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason	0
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching	1
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great	1
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and i took a good two hours to fully recover  	0
i wouldn't return	0
you can't beat the price on these	1
great for using with your home stereo	1
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years  	1

if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing	0
once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place	1
three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen  	1
the service was not up to par either	0
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul	1
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill  	1
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere	0
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others  	1
for about 10 minutes we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon	0
i especially love the long battery life	1
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him	1
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad	0
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money	1
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it  	0
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack	0
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes	1
clear skype calls long battery life long range	1
anyway i do not think i will go back there	0
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop	0
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	0
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didn't expect more tip than that	1
beautiful styling though	1
all i have to say is the food was amazing	1
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless	0
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow	1
great service and food	1
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching	1
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls  	1
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area	1
it is zillion times away from reality  	0
the food is about on par with denny's which is to say not good at all	0
soggy and not good	0
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work	0
great phone	1

generous portions and great taste	1
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle  	1
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced	0
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie  	1

i advise everyone do not be fooled	0
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot	1
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film  	1
