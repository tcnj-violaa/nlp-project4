after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes	0
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing  	1
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7	1

i loved it it was really scary  	1
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game  	1
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release  	0
an awesome new look for fall 2000	1
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet	0
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery  	0
i would recommend saving room for this	1
there were too many close ups  	0
didn't laugh or even smile once  	0
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	1
if it were possible to give them zero stars they'd have it	0
i won't be back	0
this film has no redeeming features  	0
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance  	0
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006  	1
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid	1
everything was perfect the night we were in	1
ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church  	1
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery  	0
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded  	0
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome	0

i rate this movie 910  	1
why was this film made  	0
poor product	0
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly	0
i love this place	1
i dressed up to be treated so rudely	0
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat	0
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if you're looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further  	1
it works	1
it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is	0
it's like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
camerawork  again bad  	0
even worse than ticker  	0
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action  	0
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well  	1
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here  	0
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but i'm not inspired to go back	0
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives  	1
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse  	0
the accompanied software is almost brilliant	1
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked	0
also makes it easier to hold on to	1

this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food	0
very disappointed	0
i can assure you that you won't be disappointed	1

the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever	0
this place is amazing	1

anyway i do not think i will go back there	0

if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb  complex  	1
the soundtrack sucked  	0
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods	0
this scene is very strong and unpleasant  	0
great product for the price	1
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10	1
love this headset	1
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
do not purchase this phone	0
worse there's an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	0
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside	1
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area	1
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception	1
buy a different phone  but not this	0
 they never brought a salad we asked for	0
those phones are working just fine now	1
things that went wrong  they burned the saganaki	0

very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment  	0
best tacos in town by far	1
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting	0
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way	1
i've missed numerous calls because of this reason	0
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try	1
anne heche was utterly convincing  	1
what a waste of money and time	0
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded  	0
his performance is simply genius  	1
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films  	1
talk about useless customer service	0
needless to say i wasted my money	0
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries	0
this is not moviemaking  	0
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors  	0
the construction of the headsets is poor	0
worst foodservice i've had in a while	0
great price too	1
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor	0
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only	0
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts	0
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten	0
good show samsung	1
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him  	1
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive	1
great movie  	1
it is shameful  	0
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella the dead  	1
now you know why i gave it a 10  	1
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous	1
anyway i do not think i will go back there	0
warning  stay away	0
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days	1
just had lunch here and had a great experience	1
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution	0
i'm not really sure how joey's was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine	0
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film  	1
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes	0
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food	0
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star  	1
will not be back	0
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table	1
really good product	1
on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  	0
i connected my wife's bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case	1
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite	1
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there  letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him  	1
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer	1
awkward to use and unreliable	0
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review  	0
the burrittos blah	0
works for me	1
avoid this establishment	0
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles	1
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles	0
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7	1
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast  	1
i wasn't expecting oscar material but this  	0
too politically correct  	0
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  	0
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction  	0
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown	0
good case	1
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking	0
this is not moviemaking  	0
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood	1
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene  	1
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet	0
i am sorry i made this purchase	0
this place is great	1

disappointing experience	0

the accompanied software is almost brilliant	1
it's been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation	1
overpriced for what you are getting	0
basically the service was very bad	0
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works  	1
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged	0
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing	0
it looked like a wonderful story  	1
we won't be going back anytime soon	0
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and i'm pretty happy with that decision	1
i had strawberry tea which was good	1
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry  	1
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp	1
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem	0
horrible had to switch 3 times	0
delete this film from your mind  	0
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare	0
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note i'd love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones  	1
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  	0
warning  do not buy	0
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off	0
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio  so very delightful	1
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design	0
i was very disappointed	0
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing  	0
lousy product	0
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for  	0
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable  	0
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables	0
just what i wanted	1
there were too many close ups  	0
good servicecheck	1
i'd love to go back	1
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed	0
great software for motorolas	1
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south  	1
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions	1
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable  	0

shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold	0
food was below average	0

i received it quickly and it works great	1

battery life is also great	1
eew this location needs a complete overhaul	0
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe  poor hummh  	0
superb phone on a great network	1
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way	0
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear	0
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe  poor hummh  	0

anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch	1
please dont waste your money	0
this place lacked style	0
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use	0
it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason  	0
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well	1
worth every penny	1
warning  stay away	0
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try  	1
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset	0
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on	1
overall this movie was cheap trash  	0
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area	1
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse  	0
this is not moviemaking  	0
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes	1
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda  	0
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone	0
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder  	0
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcit's all wrong  	0
great for ipods too	1
she carries the movie well  	1
it kept getting worse and worse so now i'm officially done	0
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like they're 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc  	0
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad  	0
boy was that sucker dry	0
the pleather case doesn't fit	0
very prompt service	1
great sound and service	1
even the squibs look awful  	0
she carries the movie well  	1
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food	0
it's pure brilliance  	1
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others  	1
terrible product and waste of money	0
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service	1
avoid avoid avoid  	0
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere	1
anne heche was utterly convincing  	1
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting	1
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way  	1
good item low price	1
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast  	1
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips	1
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough	0
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent	1
i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous	0
everything was fresh and delicious	1
and don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork  	0
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly	0
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr	0
all three broke within two months of use	0
it was not good	0
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie  	1
excellent wallet type phone case	1
none of it works just don't buy it	0
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back	1
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman	1

great brunch spot	1
they were excellent	1
i wouldn't recommend buying this product	0
my phone sounded ok  not great  ok but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldn't understand a word being said on it	0
it's a sad movie but very good  	1
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but i'm not inspired to go back	0
aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other debits  	0
it deserves strong love  	1
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart  	1
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre  	1
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma	1
worthwhile	1
how stupid is that	0
it's a piece of crap	0
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse  	0
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu	1
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed	0
i highly recommend this device to everyone	1
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3	0
there is no real plot  	0
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good	1
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude	0
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie  	0
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone	1
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job  	1
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table	0
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable	1
unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening	0
excellent product for the price	1
the staff are also very friendly and efficient	1
i'll give this film 10 out of 10  	1
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem	0
it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time  	1
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked	1
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  	0
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family	1
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 	1
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting	0
the food was terrible	0
this movie is bad  	0
battery is holding up well	1
price is good too	1
does not work	0
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  	0
all in all i'm quite satisfied with this purchase	1
you won't regret it	1
total waste of time	0
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i don't care how cool it looks if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless	0
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense  	0
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen  	1
those phones are working just fine now	1
i'll give this film 10 out of 10  	1
its a total package	1
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen	0
i am very happy	1
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me	0
ample portions and good prices	1
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  	0
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier	1
my headset works just peachykeen	1
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one	1
plug was the wrong size	0
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing	0
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked	1
razr battery  good buy	1
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review  	0
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws  	0
it was too predictable even for a chick flick  	0
you cant go wrong with any of the food here	1
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work	0
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there  letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him  	1
very bad experience	0
you can watch them preparing the delicious food	1
another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after  	0
what a mistake that was	0
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs  	0
overall i wasn't very impressed with noca	0
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film  	1
fantastic food	1
it was so funny  	1
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere	1
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon	0
i as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible	0
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line  	1
i could barely stomach the meal but didn't complain because it was a business lunch	0
razr battery  good buy	1
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well	1
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go  	1
still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow  	1
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable  	0
not good enough for the price	0
went in for happy hour great list of wines	1
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use	0
will be back again	1
they also have the best cheese crisp in town	1
i don't think i'll be running back to carly's anytime soon for food	0
1010  	1
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked	0
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression  	1
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes	1
very pleased with this headset	1
works for me	1
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off	0
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever  	0
however i needed some better instructions	0
love it great armband	1
i paid too much  	0
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good	1
total waste of time	0

the food amazing	1
excellent short film  	1
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry  	1
delicious and i will absolutely be back	1

it looks very nice	1
the accompanied software is almost brilliant	1
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone	0
so just beware	0
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star	0
avoid at any and all costs  	0
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection	1
nice spicy and tender	1
i came out of it feeling angry  	0
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away	1
would not go back	0
no ear loop needed it's tiny and the sound is great	1
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen	1
this is a great little item	1
hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood  	1
exceptionally bad  	0
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didn't use my common sense	0
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place	0
he was terrible	0
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us  	0
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and i'm pretty happy with that decision	1
an excellent performance from ms  	1
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child  	1
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc  	0
this place is horrible and way overpriced	0
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day	0
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all  	0
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it  	1
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tv's	1
does everything it should and more	1
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery	1
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing	1
it was horrendous  	0
the film's dialogue is natural real to life  	1
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage	0
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back  	0
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles  	1
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	0
exceptionally bad  	0
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it	0
my phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand	1
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars  	1
i don't think you will be disappointed  	1
nice solid keyboard	1
talk about great customer service of course we will be back	1
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn't receive and place calls	0
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast  	1
it was so boring  	0
2 thumbs up to this seller	1
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner	1
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this	0
honeslty it didn't taste that fresh	0
i received it quickly and it works great	1
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly	1
worst martini ever	0
also the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player	0
third the cheese on my friend's burger was cold	0
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go  	0
not too screamy not to masculine but just right  	1
i'm pleased	1
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool	1
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good	0
very disappointed in accessoryone	0
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland	0
razr battery  good buy	1
protects the phone on all sides	1
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food	0
poor quality and service	0
they will customize your order any way you'd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it	1
not my thing	0
this film has no redeeming features  	0

very good quality though	1
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection	1
