the only place good for this film is in the garbage  	0
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone  	0

the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying  	0

great product fast shipping	1
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander  	1
made very sturdy	1

i went on motorola's website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again	0
i can say that the desserts were yummy	1
friend's pasta  also bad he barely touched it	0

again lame  	0
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles	0
i am glad i purchased it	1
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher  	1
overall i don't think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too	0
an excellent performance from ms  	1
lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly won't allow  	0
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up  	0
the cast is always entertaining as usual  	1
i will never forget it now  	1
service was good and the company was better	1
mediocre food	0

a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing  	1
regrettably the film fails  	0
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register	0
this place deserves no stars	0
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  	0
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot  	0
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience  	0
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well	1
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either	0
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch  	1
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2	1
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try  	1
if you don't find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone	0
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives	0
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem  	1
battery is holding up well	1
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place	1
the worst phone i've ever had only had it for a few months	0
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds	0
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage  	1

first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever	0
i received it quickly and it works great	1

another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model	0
i'm very disappointed with my decision	0
this one is simply a disappointment	0
i liked the way dustin hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son  	1
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in	0
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch  	1
excellent	1
thoroughly disappointed	0
i'm not really sure how joey's was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine	0
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  	0
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style  	1
poor quality and service	0
we won't be going back	0
that one didn't work either	0
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there	0
this movie is bad  	0
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds	0

waste of 13 bucks	0
i wouldn't recommend buying this product	0
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all	0
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace  	0
so bad  	0
could not get strong enough signal	0
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles	0
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixar's cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories  	1
the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling  	0
crisp and clear	1
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miner's daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire  	1
great phone	1
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot  	0
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear	0
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  	0
the nachos are a must have	1
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad  	0
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff	1
great charger	1
there is nothing authentic about this place	0

the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it  	0

go watch it  	1
you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie  but you do wish for just a small sample to savor  	1

only pros  large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough	1
those burgers were amazing	1
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
this is such a fun and funny movie  	1
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time	1
the only place good for this film is in the garbage  	0
i probably would not go here again	0
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested	1
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized  	1

plug was the wrong size	0
this place should honestly be blown up	0
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything	1

all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes  	0
1 it works  2 it is comfortable	1
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing	1
it's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema  	1
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat	0
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor pizza hut coupons	0
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it	0

once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place	1
this place receives stars for their appetizers	1
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset	0

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it	1
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	1
ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church  	1
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions  	1
in short don't bother with this movie  	0
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork	0
