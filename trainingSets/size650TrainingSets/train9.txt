meredith m was better than all right  	1

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode  	0
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr	0
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something	0
fantastic food	1
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family  	1
the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it  	0
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure  	0
earbud piece breaks easily	0
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	1
i love this device	1
as i said abovepretty useless	0
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it	0
the phone was unusable and was not new	0
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous  	1

the inside is really quite nice and very clean	1
i'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place	0
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made	1

well im satisfied	1
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious	1
i was very impressed with the price of the cases	1

bad reception	0
they are so cool	1
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal	1

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors  	0
there were too many close ups  	0

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted  	1
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland	0
does everything it should and more	1
the igo chargers and tips are really great	1
lasted one day and then blew up	0
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style	0
as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it's frightening  	1
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer	0
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on  	0
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320	0

director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesn't know how to pace his films  	0
is pretty funny  	1
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either	0
you can't relate with them hell you barely can understand them  	0
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool	1

setup couldn't have been simpler	1

four stars for the food  the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe  still letting us in to eat 	1
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only	0
the fries were great too	1
when i'm on this side of town this will definitely be a spot i'll hit up again	1
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone	0
warning  do not buy	0
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	1

the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated	0
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant	1
great movie  	1
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options	1

great phone	1
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use	0
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back	1
as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening  	0
then as if i hadn't wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check	0
this show is made for americans  it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere  	0
i would highly recommend this	1
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i'm not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer  	0
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me	0
the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age  	1

it wasn't busy at all and now we know why	0
very tough and very short on flavor	0
we loved the place	1
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately	0
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line  	1
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two	0
linked to my phone without effort	1
crisp and clear	1
nice leather	1
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release  	0
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked	1
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807	0
the service was a bit lacking	0
also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design  costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar  	1
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation  	0
the transfers are very good  	1
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care  	1
you can't relate with them hell you barely can understand them  	0
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint	0

nice docking station for home or work	1
best breakfast buffet	1

the phone loads super	1
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate	0
the atmosphere here is fun	1
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic	1
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it	1

i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine	1

the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs  	0
the service was poor and thats being nice	0
horrible had to switch 3 times	0
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed	0
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch  	1
he really didn't seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests  	0

awsome device works great	1
great value	1
we've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant	0
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order	0
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good  	0
don't buy this product  it fails	0
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network	0

what a waste of money and time	0
but it is great i would really recommend it	1
there were too many close ups  	0
the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling  	0
wasted two hours  	0
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally	0
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema  	1
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected	0
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet	0
then as if i hadn't wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check	0
i'm a bit disappointed	0
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes	1
i didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me	0
nice solid keyboard	1
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices	1
however i needed some better instructions	0
even the squibs look awful  	0
soggy and not good	0
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow	1
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking  	1
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me	1
sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering  	1
can't store anything but phone numbers to sim	0
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes	1
low quality	0
the result is a film that just don't look right  	0
the only place good for this film is in the garbage  	0
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve	1
maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible	0
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something	0
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell  	0
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost  	1
the bt headset was such a disapoinment	0
waste of 13 bucks	0
good prices	1
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  	1
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone	1
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay	1
doesn't work	0
the film's dialogue is natural real to life  	1
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch	0
it was forced like everything in this movie  	0
he's a national treasure  	1
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked	0
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew  	0
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up  	1
all i have to say is the food was amazing	1
the camera really likes her in this movie  	1
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late	0
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative  	0
you can find better movies at youtube  	0
excellent dualpurpose headset	1
all things considered a job very well done  	1
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch  	1
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other  	1
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try  	1
they dropped more than the ball	0
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joe's glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene  	0
the film has an ultracheap look to it  	0
what a great double cheeseburger	1
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions  	1
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other  	1
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it	1
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great	1
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious	1
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short	0
went for lunch  service was slow	0
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service	1
great hands free device	1
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much  	0
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway	0
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good  	1
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees	0
the only downside is the service	0

lightweight and works well	1
but then they came back cold	0

i wear it everyday and it holds up very well	1
portable and it works	1
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off	0
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet	1
worked perfectly	1
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint	1
the battery is completely useless to me	0
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago	1
what happened next was prettyoff putting	0
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos	1
avoid this establishment	0
camerawork  again bad  	0
his costars don't fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted  	0
it kept getting worse and worse so now i'm officially done	0
that's a huge design flaw unless i'm not using it correctly which i don't think is the case	0
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys  	0
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i don't want to waste time on bad reviewing i'll leave it at that	0
great product	1
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal	1

damn good steak	1
setup couldn't have been simpler	1
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked	0
the character developments also lacked in depth  	0
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly	0
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it  	0
nice leather	1
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous	1
the nachos are a must have	1
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure	1
what this film lacks is a convincing script  	0
i'm so happy to be here	1
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i	1
i went on motorola's website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again	0
