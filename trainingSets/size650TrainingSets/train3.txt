i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent	1

i'm happy about this purchase good quality and low price	1

just spicy enough perfect actually	1
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
you'll love it  	1
trumbull on i love lucy  	1
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  	1
go and see it  	1

the best scene in the movie is at the end but i won't spoil it  	1
this isn't a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment	1
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving  	0
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing	0
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there	0

i cannot make calls at certain places	0
pretty cool i would say	1

the foreigner is not worth one second of your time  	0
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  	0
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was	1
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more  	0
it's a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this  	0
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense  	0

ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up  	1
in short don't bother with this movie  	0
the accompanied software is almost brilliant	1
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears	1
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1

great price too	1
give it a try you will be happy you did	1
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white lowbudget original  	1
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor	0
useless phone simply deaf	0
what this film lacks is a convincing script  	0
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre  	1

the manager was the worst	0
stay away from this store be careful	0

it fits my ear well and is comfortable on	1
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good	0
the goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what flavor	1
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate  	1
while you don't yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928  	1
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere	1
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone	0

i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume	0
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once	1
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  	0
never going back	0

much better than the hard plastic cases	1
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible	1

never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part  	0
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside	1
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old  	1
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience  	1
great brunch spot	1
give this one a look  	1
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger	0

i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job	0
i've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone i've had	1
those burgers were amazing	1
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing  	0
camera color balance is awful	0
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line  	1
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas	1
the service was a little slow  considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace	0
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach	0
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion  	1
go watch it  	1
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset	0
the service was terrible though	0

now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty	1
how can that bethe audio quality is poor	0
the portion was huge	1
great product	1
excellent service	1
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  	0
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid 750 to see this crap  	0
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone	0
the portion was huge	1
unfortunately any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script  	0
i'd advise anyone to go and see it  	1
i don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt	0
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean	1
food was below average	0

good transmit audio	1
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design	0
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle  	1
the selection of food was not the best	0
as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it's frightening  	1
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but i'm not inspired to go back	0
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish	0
my first visit to hiro was a delight	1

this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food	0
very disappointing  	0
horrible horrible protector	0
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register	0
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time i'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago	1
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price	1
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief  	0
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it	1
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone	1
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip	0
best tacos in town by far	1
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie  	0
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing	1
will not be back	0
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm	1
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture  	0
we waited for forty five minutes in vain	0
i recently tried caballero's and i have been back every week since	1
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure	1
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesn't know how to pace his films  	0
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm	1
of course the acting is blah  	0
i'm glad this pretentious piece of s didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec  	0
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting  	1
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad	0
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real  	1

the reception is excellent	1
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far	1

i'm pleased	1
very very fun chef	1
this phone might well be the worst i've ever had in any brand	0
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal	0
all in all i think it was a good investment	1
works great	1
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland	0
comfortable nice range good battery life	1
waitress was sweet and funny	1

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors  	0
we definately enjoyed ourselves	1
great software for motorolas	1

spend your money elsewhere	0
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold	0
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section	1
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho	1
unfortunately 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain  	0
i've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear	0
great earpiece	1
great product	1
very very fun chef	1
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star  	1
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad	0
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale  	1
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  	1
no ear loop needed it's tiny and the sound is great	1
it was just not a fun experience	1
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left	0
but i definitely would not eat here again	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever	0
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of	1
the worst was the salmon sashimi	0
as for the service i'm a fan because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks	1
used and dirty	0
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole  	1
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today  	1
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb  complex  	1
the shrimp tender and moist	1
it is a really good show to watch  	1
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun	1
extremely tasty	1
needless to say we will never be back here again	0
funny clever hip  just like pray's previous film hype  	1
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad	1

the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten	1
conclusion very filling meals	1
i came out of it feeling angry  	0
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order	0
excellent	1
the film lacks any real scares or tension  some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least  i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself  	0
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately	0
works great	1
on the up side their cafe serves really good food	1
i really liked that  	1
totally believable  	1
only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far	1
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk	0
it was just too horrible  	0
good protection and does not make phone too bulky	1
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him  	1
it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason  	0
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon	0
worthless product	0
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first	0
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would	0
do not waste your money here	0
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place  	0
the mic is great	1
i can't wait to go back	1
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area	1
utter crap sound quality is terrible	0
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2	1
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasn't great	0
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack	0
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before  	0
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception	1
good food  good service 	1
i want my money back	0
the battery works great	1
talk about useless customer service	0
first time there and might just be the last	0
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one  	1
i would highly recommend this product	1
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them	1
performed awful  muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call	0
waitress was a little slow in service	0
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable  	0
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is  	1
left very frustrated	0
unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening	0
 both the hot  sour  the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars	1
 in fact it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself  	1
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it  	1
the service here is fair at best	0
needless to say i won't be going back anytime soon	0
what i really like there is the crepe station	1
defective crap	0
you can watch them preparing the delicious food	1
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative  	0
it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films  	0
everything about this movie is stupid  	0
eclectic selection	1
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast  	0
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop	0
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema  	1
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting  	0
very satisifed with that	1
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets  	1
ordered burger rare came in we'll done	0
excellent bluetooth headset	1
hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood  	1
the worst was the salmon sashimi	0
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts	0
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0
this is the first phone i've had that has been so cheaply made	0
magical help	1
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm	0
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume	0
definitely a bargain	1
works like a charm works as advertised	1
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles	1
i wasn't the least bit interested  	0
i wouldn't return	0
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer	0
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad  	0
customer service was terrible	0
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year	1
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does	0
the price is reasonable and the service is great	1
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids  	1
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film  	1
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater	0
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good	1
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film  	1
great product	1
the movie showed a lot of florida at it's best made it look very appealing  	1
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute	1
great subway in fact it's so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations	1

this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa  	1
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap	0
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit	1
waste of money	0
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing  	0
couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal	1
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere	1
i've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear	0
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc	0
the waitress and manager are so friendly	1
and it was way to expensive	0
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears	0
basically the service was very bad	0
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing	1
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldn't have even been created  	0
i'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere	0
i'm super pissd	0
one of the worst shows of all time  	0
timely shipment and quality product	1
they know how to make them here	1
