the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	0
someone shouldve invented this sooner	1
lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age  	0
i've missed numerous calls because of this reason	0
