for about 10 minutes we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon	0

this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  	0
i as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible	0
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money	0
it was so cool  	1
sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering  	1
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget  	1

each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious	1
great choice	1

i've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one i've found that fits my ear comfortably	1
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest  	0
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc  	0
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead  	1
top line don't waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes  	0
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time i'm in vegas	1
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy	0
spoilers whatever else can or can't be said about it surface is superbly crafted  	1

this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre  	1
great value	1
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations  	1
a pretty good product	1
i've never been more insulted or felt disrespected	0
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days	0
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years  	1
you can't beat the price on these	1
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part  	0
only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far	1
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor	1

it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs  	0
i would recommend saving room for this	1
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm	1
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc	1
i hate writing bad reviews about films  especially those in which i really like the star  but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it  	0
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job  	1
will order from them again	1
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables	0
the script iswas there a script  	0
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this  bad idea we both hated it  	0

how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak i don't understand	0
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well	1
it's a feelgood film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema  	1
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i won't be going back	0
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this	0
works well	1
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off	0
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense  	0
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me  	1
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad	0
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale  	1
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in	0
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine  	1
we'd definitely go back here again	1

worst foodservice i've had in a while	0
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it	0
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either	0
it's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg	0
i won't be back	0
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for	0
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds	0
my rating just 3 out of 10  	0
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with  	1
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price	1
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7	1
performed awful  muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call	0
works as described	1
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then i'm lost	0
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected	1
dont waste your money	0
all in all i think it was a good investment	1
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807	0
it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films  	0

very tough and very short on flavor	0
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time	1
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it	0

the reception is excellent	1
superb phone on a great network	1
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them	1
we enjoy their pizza and brunch	1
would not reccommend	0
yet i enjoy watching it  	1
it was also the right balance of war and love  	1
this is a great deal	1
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear	1
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast  	0
there is no plot or storyline  	0
i came out of it feeling angry  	0
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon  	1

def coming back to bowl next time	1
it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'  	0
the suspense builders were good  just cross the line from g to pg  	1

your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked	0
this place receives stars for their appetizers	1
mishima is extremely uninteresting  	0
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made  	1
i've missed numerous calls because of this reason	0
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent  	1
the kids are annoying  	0
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve	1
terrible phone holder	0
their daily specials are always a hit with my group	1

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer	0
hitchcock is a great director  	1
up there with the best of melville  	1
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious	1
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going  	1
we'll never go again	0
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch  	1
internet is excrutiatingly slow	0
i mean this in a terrible way  	0
and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you  the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors  	0
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic  a real treat	1
i started this review with two stars but i'm editing it to give it only one	0
i will never forget it now  	1
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all	0
you can watch them preparing the delicious food	1

extremely tasty	1
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic	1
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside	1
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy	1
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  	1
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts	0
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great	0
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite	1
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again	0
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign	0
brilliant  	1
once your food arrives it's meh	0
maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible	0
go rent it  	1
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm	1
the music in the film is really nice too  	1
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good	1
the story is also both funny and poignant at times  	1
i cannot make calls at certain places	0

this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award  	1
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product	1
i also had to taste my mom's multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious	1
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago  	1
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone	1
the kids play area is nasty	0
as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening  	0
interesting decor	1
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end	1
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly	1
just had lunch here and had a great experience	1
the accompanied software is almost brilliant	1
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars  	1
very good quality though	1
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film  	1
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure	1
incredible	1
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza	1
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films  	1
great product and price	1
but then they came back cold	0
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe  nice ambiance clean friendly staff	1
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art  	1
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma	1
i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie  	0
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly	0
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review	0
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see  	1
it's close to my house it's lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food	1
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar	1
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself  	1
thank you for such great service	1
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale	0
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did	1

steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day	0
i'll even say it again  this is torture  	0
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other  	1
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	0
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child  	1
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr  	1
i am sorry i made this purchase	0
was not happy	0
i'm happy about this purchase good quality and low price	1
what a disappointment	0
while you don't yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928  	1
will not be back	0
all in all i think it was a good investment	1
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics	1
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed	1
nice spicy and tender	1
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably  	0
it is worth the drive	1
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
the waitress and manager are so friendly	1
works like a charm works as advertised	1
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie  	1
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time	1
his performance is simply genius  	1
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality	1
they work about 2 weeks then break	0
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere  	0
good value works fine  power via usb car or wall outlet	1
it was forced like everything in this movie  	0
that was nice  	1
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever	0
i would recommend this	1
awesome device	1
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer	0
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard  	1
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed	0
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone	1
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	0
i'm pleased	1
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers  	1
fast service	1
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0
definitely worth checking out  	1
great product	1
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices	0
for about 10 minutes we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon	0
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in	0
the pizza selections are good	1
someone shouldve invented this sooner	1
these are the nicest restaurant owners i've ever come across	1
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning  	0
she carries the movie well  	1
the bartender was also nice	1
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression  	1
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude	1
i really liked that  	1
terrible my car will not accept this cassette	0
i like armand assante  my cable company's summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again  	1
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave  	1
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom  	0
no complaints	1
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better	1
it was quite comfortable in the ear	1
disappointed with battery	0
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this  	1
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives	0
a film not easily forgotten  	1
i'm happy about this purchase good quality and low price	1
a pretty good product	1
excellent performance  	1
i found this product to be waaay too big	0
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film  it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation  	0
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait	0
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water	0
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked	0
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk  	0
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast  	1
i started this review with two stars but i'm editing it to give it only one	0
echo problemvery unsatisfactory	0
fast service	1
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes	0
i'd advise anyone to go and see it  	1
very unreliable service from tmobile 	0
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon	1
food was great and so was the serivce	1
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it	0
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was	1
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious	1
 in fact it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself  	1
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid	1
this is infuriating	0
after charging overnight these batteries work great	1
restored my phone to like new performance	1
terrible product and waste of money	0
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company	0
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great	1
the only place good for this film is in the garbage  	0
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists  	1
this is an excellent film  	1
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again	1
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying  	0
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not	0
won't ever go here again	0
i probably would not go here again	0
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 	0
great subway in fact it's so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations	1
they have great dinners	1
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser	1
we'll never go again	0
needless to say i won't be going back anytime soon	0
i love their fries and their beans	1
this is such a fun and funny movie  	1
and i just love the colors	1
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse	0
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere	1
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  	1
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed	0
what the hell kind of crap is that  	0
i heart this place	1
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic  	1
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it	0
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole  	1
i'm glad this pretentious piece of s didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of québec  	0
good prices	1
after one bite i was hooked	1
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene  	0
give it a try you will be happy you did	1
it was a drive to get there	0
i'm very disappointed with my decision	0
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes	0
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  	1
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting  	1
brilliant  	1
this movie is bad  	0
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop  	1
we would recommend these to others	1
still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow  	1
what a great double cheeseburger	1
i love this thing	1
it was so boring  	0
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years  	1
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good	1
this is not moviemaking  	0
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  	1
both great	1
i've bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these	0
very disappointed	0

he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery	1
great service and food	1
this place was such a nice surprise	1
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher  	1
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears	1
waste of 13 bucks	0
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us	0
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced	1
i'm happy about this purchase good quality and low price	1
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means	0
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander  	1
the ambiance was incredible	1
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous  	1
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well	1

excellent phone	1
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron	0
now this is a movie i really dislike  	0
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking  	1
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it  	1
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i'm not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer  	0
best headset ever	1
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating	0
service was fantastic	1
we'd definitely go back here again	1
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  	1
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original  	0
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good  	0
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core  	0
waste of money	0

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus	1
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america  	0
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing	0
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
everything was fresh and delicious	1
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable	1
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  	0
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  	1
ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church  	1
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility  	1
it's close to my house it's lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food	1
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve	1
if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time  	0
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family  	1
battery is terrible	0
the bartender was also nice	1
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7	1
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza	1
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  	0
we are sending it back	0
battery is terrible	0
very disappointed in accessoryone	0
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie  	1
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming	1
if someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart	0
superb phone on a great network	1

i loved it it was really scary  	1
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous  	1

it was equally awful	0
same problem as others have mentioned	0
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again	0
if you want a real scare rent this one  	1

the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12	0
do not waste your money here	0
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on  	0
lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly won't allow  	0
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma	1
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  	1
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted	0
conclusion  i loved it  	1
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times  	0
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies i've ever seen  	0
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order	0
and finally after all that we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell  	0

a pretty good product	1
even the squibs look awful  	0
food was really boring	0
worthless product	0
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears	0
greatno problems at all	1
the turkey and roast beef were bland	0
it shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs	0

i was bored throughout the whole damn thing  	0
the management is rude	0
the burrittos blah	0
i am also very happy with the price	1

it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry	0
the story line is just awful  	0
those phones are working just fine now	1
i'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere	0
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs  	0
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place	0

food quality has been horrible	0
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent	1
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12	0

it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is	0
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good	1
couldn't use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas	0
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing	1

kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord  	1
service was fantastic	1
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means	0
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care  	1
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters	1
maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible	0
my friend did not like his bloody mary	0
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical  	0
best headset ever	1
better than you'd expect	1
the only downside is the service	0

when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick  	0
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing	0
i do think tom hanks is a good actor  	1
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor  	1
but i thought his acting was skilled  	1

i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food	0
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try  	1
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other  	1
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i'm not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer  	0
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these  	0
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop  	1
razr battery  good buy	1
buttons are too small	0
i enjoyed it  	1
but tiny toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created  	1

steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1
if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time  	0
also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design  costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar  	1
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting	1
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not	0
i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there  	0
this movie is bad  	0
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr	0
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face  	1
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous  	1
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh	0
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters	1
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case	1
this phone might well be the worst i've ever had in any brand	0
stay away from the q	0
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely  	0
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water	0
the result is a film that just don't look right  	0
after two i felt disgusting	0
definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness  	1
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully	1
i wouldnt see this movie again for free  	0
also it's a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse  	1

alexander nevsky is a great film  	1
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public  	0
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service	1

a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design	0
the igo chargers and tips are really great	1
even worse than ticker  	0
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is  	0
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  	0
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late	0
i would not recommend this item to anyone	0
his performance as awarded was stunning  	1
go and see it  	1
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up	0
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices	0
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means	0
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone	0
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable  	0
i received it quickly and it works great	1
the range is very decent i've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues	1
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura  	1
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	1
5 stars for the brick oven bread app	1
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor	0
earbud piece breaks easily	0
the film looks cheap and bland  	0
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known	0
this place is great	1
wasted two hours  	0
i'm trying to return it for a refund	0
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus  	0
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all	0
the staff are also very friendly and efficient	1
it is very comfortable on the ear	1
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up  	1

these were so good we ordered them twice	1
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 	1
a bit predictable  	0
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design	0
and finally after all that we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell  	0
maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible	0
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos	1
this is an extraordinary film  	1
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	0
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone	0
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games	0
and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you  the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors  	0
the management is rude	0
i'm so happy to be here	1
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf  	0
is pretty funny  	1
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun	1
 the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	1
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough	1
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse	0
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miner's daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire  	1
i've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it	1
it was pretty gross	0
disappointed	0
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching	1
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it	0
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
provides good protection and looks classy too	1
disapointing results	0

i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago  	1
good quality	1
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria	1

this is a good joint	1
a greasy unhealthy meal	0
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before  	0

of course the acting is blah  	0
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced	0
the commercials are the most misleading	0
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie  	0
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees	0
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode  	0
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with  	1
these were so good we ordered them twice	1
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked	0
i believe that pitch black was done well  	1
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution	0

when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad	0

their menu is diverse and reasonably priced	1
the noise shield is incrediable	1

but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before	1
i didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious	1
too bad you have to pay up to  a month for the service	0

even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying	0
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  	1
i wouldnt see this movie again for free  	0
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked	0
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch	1
now i know that i made a wise decision	1
his performance is simply genius  	1
sooooo good	1
it was packed	0
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year	1
generally it just lacked imagination  	0
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film  	1
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however it's not	1
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
avoid this film at all costs  	0

i am very happy	1
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic  	0
bad reception	0
what a waste of money and time	0
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while	0

it definitely was not as good as my s11	1
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn  	1
avoid at any and all costs  	0
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon	1
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had	1
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money	1
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem  	1
everything is appalling  	0
great headset very impressed  h500	1
i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
it wasn't busy either also the building was freezing cold	0
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  	1
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal	1
both do good jobs and are quite amusing  	1
so good i am going to have to review this place twice  once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night	1

for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food	0
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced	0
but even the talented carrell can't save this  	0

the soundtrack wasn't terrible either  	1
being a 90's child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons  	1

i've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one i've found that fits my ear comfortably	1
i just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine	0
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me  	1
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying	0
a pretty good product	1
the kids play area is nasty	0
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot  	0
it's a sad movie but very good  	1
the macarons here are insanely good	1
then the film just dropped the ball  	0
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125	0
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff	1
as for the mains also uninspired	0
i'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere	0
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles	1
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene  	0
definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness  	1
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe  nice ambiance clean friendly staff	1
a fly was in my apple juice a fly	0
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me	0

overall this movie was cheap trash  	0
my friend did not like his bloody mary	0
they will customize your order any way you'd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it	1

fantastic earphones	1
the fries were great too	1
echo problemvery unsatisfactory	0
best tacos in town by far	1
his performance as awarded was stunning  	1
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast	1
it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy  	0
great product	1
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried	1
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse  	1
 in fact it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself  	1
this show is made for americans  it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere  	0
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off	1
the script is horrendously stupid  	0
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked	0
it was forced like everything in this movie  	0
warning  stay away	0
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable  	1
there's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts  	1
but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn  	0
my girlfriend's veal was very bad	0
absolutely great	1
we are sending it back	0
i was mortified	0
maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible	0
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance  	1
excellent	1
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made	1
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying	0
lasted one day and then blew up	0
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser	1
i will come back here every time i'm in vegas	1
but it is entertaining nonetheless  	1
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film  	1
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had	1
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet	0
once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place	1
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food	0

tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked	0
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it	0

the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem  	1
great brunch spot	1
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage	0
don't bother coming here	0
i was very disappointed in the movie  	0
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through  	0
good quality	1
food was really boring	0
better than new	1
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  	0
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better	0
but this movie really got to me  	1
long whiny and pointless  	0
the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim  	1
definitely a turn off for me  i doubt i'll be back unless someone else is buying	0
it is a really good show to watch  	1
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars	0
audio quality is poor very poor	0

this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others  	1
portable and it works	1
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice	0
if you are reading this please don't go there	0
then there's the plot holes  	0
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made  	1
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i'm not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer  	0
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers	0
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized  	1
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted  	1
it's not hard to make a decent hamburger	0
phenomenal food service and ambiance	1
and there wasn't a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here  	1
worked perfectly	1
it is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it	1
the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right  	0
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me  	1
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf  	0
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset	0
2 thumbs up	1
i don't think i'll be running back to carly's anytime soon for food	0
the price is reasonable and the service is great	1
poor quality and service	0
we've tried to like this place but after 10 times i think we're done with them	0

both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract  	1
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it	0
i never walked out of a movie faster  	0
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all  	0
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak	1
went for lunch  service was slow	0
so don't go there if you are looking for good food	0

i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking  	1
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked	0
works for me	1
ample portions and good prices	1
the script is a big flawed mess  	0
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today	0
the food is about on par with denny's which is to say not good at all	0
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland	0
i also didn't like the on button it felt like it would crack with use	0
magical help	1
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way  	1
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldn't have even been created  	0
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic  a real treat	1
very much disappointed with this company	0
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful	0
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  	1
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service	1
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative  	0
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine	1
very prompt service	1
great product	1
feelings thoughtsgabriel's discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal  	1
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  	0
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby	1
this movie is also revealing  	1
i love lane but i've never seen her in a movie this lousy  	0
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point	0

worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries	0
it's not hard to make a decent hamburger	0
terrible management	0
it's very attractive and appears to be of good quality	1
i still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones we just obviously don't share enough dna to copy the design over to humans	0
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here  	1
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans  	1
i'm trying to return it for a refund	0
the turkey and roast beef were bland	0
plan on ordering from them again and again	1

my phone sounded ok  not great  ok but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldn't understand a word being said on it	0

alexander nevsky is a great film  	1
the kids are very cool too  	1
 i love it  	1
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent	1
good price	1
one of the worst shows of all time  	0
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldn't have even been created  	0
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  	0
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days	1
will order from them again	1
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier	1
i won't try going back there even if it's empty	0
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery  	0
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  	0
another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model	0
i don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving	0
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever	0
what a waste	0
all in all i can assure you i'll be back	1
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other  	1
good protection and does not make phone too bulky	1
maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible	0
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy	1
this one just fails to create any real suspense  	0
this movie is so awesome  	1
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food	0
don't waste your money	0

not too screamy not to masculine but just right  	1
don't buy this product	0
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week  but still lasts longer than thereplacement	0
 comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously	1
filmiing was less expansive  	0
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i don't expect any problems	1
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous	1
on the up side their cafe serves really good food	1
you can watch them preparing the delicious food	1
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged	0
that's a huge design flaw unless i'm not using it correctly which i don't think is the case	0
i highly recommend this device to everyone	1
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them  	0
she carries the movie well  	1
then our food came out disappointment ensued	0
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 	1
why was this film made  	0
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity  	0
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs	0
avoid this one if you can	0
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management	0
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7	1
the music in the film is really nice too  	1

 the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	1
restaurant is always full but never a wait	1
then the film just dropped the ball  	0
 the food is rich so order accordingly	1
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked  	0
saggy floppy piece of junk	0
the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age  	1
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap  	0
very satisifed with that	1
i don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store it's not even a real movie  	0
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant	1
the turkey and roast beef were bland	0
he was terrible	0

great case and price	1
each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious	1
four stars for the food  the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe  still letting us in to eat 	1

unfortunately it was not good	0
everything from acting to cinematography was solid  	1
i'm happy about this purchase good quality and low price	1
overall this movie was cheap trash  	0
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there	1
i can say that the desserts were yummy	1
wont work right or atleast for me	0
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old  	1
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me	1
they were excellent	1
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles	0
camerawork  again bad  	0
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate  	1
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably  	0
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed	0
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable  	1

i was seated immediately	1
bt50 battery junk	0
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special	1
the service was a bit lacking	0
it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time  	1
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you won't be disappointed	1
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart  	1

the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked	0

the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked	1
i've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me	1
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk	0

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay	1
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125	0
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor	0
delicious	1
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didn't overwhelm the soup	1
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much  	0
better than new	1
definitely a turn off for me  i doubt i'll be back unless someone else is buying	0

i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  	1
this is a great phone	1

this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1

try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service	1
their research and development division obviously knows what they're doing	1
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful	1
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well	0
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would	0
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers	1
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign	0
 the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	1
that was done in the second movie  	0

long whiny and pointless  	0

this film has no redeeming features  	0
best breakfast buffet	1
battery has no life	0
lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly won't allow  	0
very pleased with this headset	1
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldn't eat here again	0
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me	0

best headset ever	1
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isn't it	0
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid	1
worse there's an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	0
but tiny toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created  	1
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful  	0
i won't try going back there even if it's empty	0
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality	1
all things considered a job very well done  	1
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it	0
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset	0
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve	1
now you know why i gave it a 10  	1
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid  	0

duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance  	1
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience  	0

this is infuriating	0
 anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot  	1
the phone gets extremely hot	0
has been working great	1
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
the commercials are the most misleading	0
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0
omg the food was delicioso	1
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it	0
i took back my money and got outta there	0
the character developments also lacked in depth  	0
i would recommend saving room for this	1
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  	0
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant	1
won't go back	0
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list	0

and don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork  	0
as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening  	0
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat	0
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking  	1
the real disappointment was our waiter	0
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  	0
either way it sucks  	0
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving  	0
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance  	1
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration	0
as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening  	0
avoid this film at all costs  	0

plug was the wrong size	0
this movie is so awesome  	1
i don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea	1

great charger	1
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful  	0

i'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place	0
waitress was good though	1
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable  	1
the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite  	0
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great	1
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor	0
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible	1
