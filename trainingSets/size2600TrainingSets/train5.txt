this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1

we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast	1
it doesn't work in europe or asia	0
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	0
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid  	0

one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it  	1
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good  	0

all three broke within two months of use	0
great product fast shipping	1

in a word it is embarrassing  	0
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1

didn't laugh or even smile once  	0
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life  	0
the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it  	0

piece of trash	0
wow very spicy but delicious	1
great bluetooth	1
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
someone shouldve invented this sooner	1
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk  	0

excellent starter wireless headset	0
the film has an ultracheap look to it  	0
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint	1
the very idea of it was lame  take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie  	0

this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere  	0
as for the service i'm a fan because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks	1
i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive  	0

everything from acting to cinematography was solid  	1
the live music on fridays totally blows	0

great movie  	1
probably not in a hurry to go back	0
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted	1

the food amazing	1
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint	1
everything was fresh and delicious	1
nice headset priced right	1
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time i'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago	1
it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is	0

the best electronics of the available fm transmitters	1
it quit working after i'd used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset i've ever owned	1
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table	1
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate  	1
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul	1
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script  	1
the staff are also very friendly and efficient	1
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon	0
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it	0
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with	0

the block was amazing	1
we've tried to like this place but after 10 times i think we're done with them	0
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper	1
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there	1
but tiny toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created  	1
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda	0
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  	0
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing  	0
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family	1
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently	0

sending it back	0

the acting as you'd expect from this cast is top notch  	1
the instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used	0

then there's the plot holes  	0
and then tragedy struck	0
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art  	1

if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us	0

this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic  	0

the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film  	1
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it	1
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	0
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside	1
if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time  	0
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them	0
all three broke within two months of use	0
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud	1
furthermore you can't even find hours of operation on the website	0
the best phone in market 	1
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue  	0
my rating just 3 out of 10  	0
piece of trash	0
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous	1
the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it  	0
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery	0
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way  	1
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original  	0
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries	0
either way it sucks  	0
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service	1
i'm super pissd	0
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year	1
again lame  	0
this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon	0
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions	1
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh	0
greatno problems at all	1
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu	1
it is very comfortable on the ear	1
i received it quickly and it works great	1
also it's a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse  	1
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater	0
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try	1
don't buy it	0
the fries were great too	1
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week  but still lasts longer than thereplacement	0
all in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money  	0
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever	0
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone	0
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think we'll just go to ninja sushi next time	0
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew  	0
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up	0
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here	0
wont work right or atleast for me	0
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff	1
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine	1
there's really nothing bad i can say about this headset	0
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all	1
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad  	0
great product fast shipping	1
i love this phone	1
avoid this establishment	0
i want my money back	0
also great directing and photography  	1
great phone	1
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it	0
another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model	0
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead	1
the bt headset was such a disapoinment	0
nice leather	1
and there wasn't a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here  	1
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us	0
same evening him and i are both drastically sick	0
as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it's frightening  	1
good quality	1
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie  	0
that's a huge design flaw unless i'm not using it correctly which i don't think is the case	0
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done  	0
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning  	0
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff	1
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it  	0
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round  	0
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion  	1
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop	0
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon	1
four stars for the food  the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe  still letting us in to eat 	1
the food was terrible	0
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point	0
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked	0
after one bite i was hooked	1
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all	0
we would recommend these to others	1
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years  	1
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn't receive and place calls	0
it's like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note i'd love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones  	1
i'd rather eat airline food seriously	0
i promise they won't disappoint	1
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems	0
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant	1
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold	0
it's dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time  	0
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too  	0
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad	0
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution	0
a truly truly bad film  	0
i highly recommend this case	1
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it  	1

say bye bye to your tip lady	0
i only hear garbage for audio	0
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing	0
great phone	1
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best	0
horrible horrible protector	0
overall i don't think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too	0
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist  	0
 that movie was bad  	0
love the margaritas too	1
i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull  	0
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet	0
the service was meh	0
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show  	0
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  	0
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic	1
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked  	0
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it  	1
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go  	0
a truly truly bad film  	0
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2	1

anne heche was utterly convincing  	1
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us	0
you get what you pay for i guess	0
nice case feels good in your hands	1
i loved the bacon wrapped dates	1
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere  	0
that was nice  	1
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc  	0
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching	1
only pros  large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough	1
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless	0
generous portions and great taste	1
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant	0
he really didn't seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests  	0
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good  	0
aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other debits  	0
very windresistant	1
great hands free device	1
works well	1
the worst was the salmon sashimi	0
what did bother me was the slow service	0
great for using with your home stereo	1
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa  is that the new phone on tv	1
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days	1
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected	1
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0
great pocket pc  phone combination	1
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution	0
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter	1

i rate this movie 910  	1
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just can't go wrong	1
very disappointing	0
i don't each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here	1

this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems	1
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  	0

those phones are working just fine now	1

treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount	0
it definitely was not as good as my s11	1
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland	0
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast  	0
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists  	1

i have read other's reviews here but i haven't had any problem with it	1
i loved it it was really scary  	1

great price too	1

worst martini ever	0
i don't think i'll be running back to carly's anytime soon for food	0

food was really good and i got full petty fast	1
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0

unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening	0
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza	1
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it  	1
i probably won't be back to be honest	0

perfect for the ps3	1
it doesn't work in europe or asia	0
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one	0
the soundtrack sucked  	0
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best	1
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch  	1

waited 2 hours  never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did	0
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working	0

also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design  costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar  	1

it was a drive to get there	0

the instruction manual is lacking	0
terrible my car will not accept this cassette	0
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop  	1

at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes	0
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder	1
so good i am going to have to review this place twice  once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night	1
i do not know if this was emilio estevez's directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye  	1

awsome device works great	1
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch  	1
the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce  	0
just what i wanted	1
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures  	0
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone	1

the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby	1
go and see it  	1
everything was fresh and delicious	1
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold  	1
not my thing	0
earbud piece breaks easily	0
as for the mains also uninspired	0
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely  	0
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside	1

nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film  	1
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there  	1
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it  	1
my first visit to hiro was a delight	1
wont work right or atleast for me	0
the script is horrendously stupid  	0
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age  	1
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	1
this place is two thumbs upway up	1

the sides are delish  mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn  beateous	1
great software for motorolas	1
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film  it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation  	0
on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  	0
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking  	1
would recommend this item	1
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it	1

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens	0
the replacement died in a few weeks	0
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad	0
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty  	0
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed	0
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  	1

i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was  	1
overall i like there food and the service	1
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything	0

i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza	1
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
the case is great and works fine with the 680	1

disappointed	0

echo problemvery unsatisfactory	0
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk  	0
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  	0
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead	1
the instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used	0
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one	1

the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc	1
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  	0
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold  	1
i also didn't like the on button it felt like it would crack with use	0
my rating just 3 out of 10  	0
and it was way to expensive	0
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would	0
the only thing i wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as i don't like it puréed	0

muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off	0
there were too many close ups  	0
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume	0
attempting artiness with black  white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed  became even more ridiculous  as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent  	0
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  	1
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died	0
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service	1
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this  	1

bt50 battery junk	0
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution	0

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script  	1
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not	0
i go to far too many places and i've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400	0
it felt too light and tinny	0
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher  	1
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful  	0
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza	1
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it	1
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  	0

that's rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good	1
bad fit way too big	0
doesn't hold charge	0
this device is great in several situations1	1
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  	0
it is a really good show to watch  	1
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly	0
probably never coming back and wouldn't recommend it	0
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse  	1
in short  this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film  	0
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script  	1
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible	0

first time there and might just be the last	0
i don't have to be an accountant to know i'm getting screwed	0
but it is entertaining nonetheless  	1
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr  	1
i couldn't think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy  	1
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor	0
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  	1
here's where the movie really pied me off  	0
i especially love the long battery life	1
great product fast shipping	1
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint	1
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene  	0
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries	0
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  	0
definitely not worth the 3 i paid	0
i'd rather eat airline food seriously	0
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries	0
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product	1
wont work right or atleast for me	0
overall i wasn't very impressed with noca	0
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it	0
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me	0
sweetest phone	1
it was a great phone	1

they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers	1
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone	0
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source	1
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go  	0

the igo chargers and tips are really great	1
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way	0
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser	1
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it	0
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe  nice ambiance clean friendly staff	1
it's been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation	1
i was very disappointed in the movie  	0
i don't know what the big deal is about this place but i won't be back ya'all	0

cool phone	1

both do good jobs and are quite amusing  	1
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions	1
after my phone got to be about a year old it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part	0
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film  	1
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting	1
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  	0

it was equally awful	0
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly	0

very disappointing	0
good show samsung	1
echo problemvery unsatisfactory	0
the story itself is just predictable and lazy  	0
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's  	1
sauce was tasteless	0
it was absolutely amazing	1
i won't try going back there even if it's empty	0
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service	1
warning  do not buy	0
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever  	1
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down	0
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door	0
another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after  	0
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is  	0
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow	1
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak i don't understand	0
you wont regret it  	1
see both films if you can  	1
also it's a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse  	1
 comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously	1
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad  	0
can't upload ringtones from a third party	0
what a mistake	0
it's a sad movie but very good  	1
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case	1
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart  	1
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious	1
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back	1
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened	0
pretty good beer selection too	1
echo problemvery unsatisfactory	0
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees	0
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible	0
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one	0
waste of money	0
avoid this film at all costs  	0
very disappointed in accessoryone	0
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends	1
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if you're looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further  	1
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference  	1
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot	1
this place is two thumbs upway up	1
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management	0
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic	1
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts  	1
the food was great as always compliments to the chef	1
the staff was very attentive	1
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted  	1
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest  	0
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way  	1
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again	0
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it	0
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series  	1
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0

this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  	1
hell no will i go back	0
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown	0
great sound and service	1

i connected my wife's bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case	1
stay away from the q	0
great sound and service	1
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning	1
a greasy unhealthy meal	0
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	0
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is  	0
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film  	1
i own 2 of these cases and would order another	1
very pleased with this headset	1
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous	1
as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening  	0
cumbersome design	0
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died	0
lots of holes in the script  	0
it's a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results	1
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation  	0
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed	0
 the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	1
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume	0
after all the rave reviews i couldn't wait to eat herewhat a disappointment	0
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant	0
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros	0
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion  	1
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product	1
it's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg	0
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldn't have even been created  	0
 a happy wonderful feel good ending  	1
the commercials are the most misleading	0
great for ipods too	1
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland	0
now the burgers aren't as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless	0
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount	0
i went to bachi burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed	1
i heart this place	1
great food	1
avoid avoid avoid  	0
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is  	1
the sides are delish  mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn  beateous	1
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years  	1
nice case feels good in your hands	1
if you want a real scare rent this one  	1
an excellent performance from ms  	1
the worst phone i've ever had only had it for a few months	0
performed awful  muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call	0
i don't each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here	1
great bluetooth	1
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because there's nothing lower  	0
mishima is extremely uninteresting  	0
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia	1
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria	1
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza	1
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money	1
give it a try you will be happy you did	1
summary the witticisms weren't witty  	0
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate	0
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous  	1
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet	0
the burger had absolutely no flavor  the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor	0
very disappointed	0
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there	1
the price is reasonable and the service is great	1
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite	1
i highly recommend this device to everyone	1

i was mortified	0
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	0

after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well	1

a fly was in my apple juice a fly	0
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it	1

generous portions and great taste	1
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place	0

the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  	0
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive	1
does not fit	0
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded  	0
