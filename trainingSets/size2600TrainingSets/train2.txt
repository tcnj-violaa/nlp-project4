thoroughly disappointed	0

the least said about the acting the better  	0
it was way over fried	0
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all	0
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one	1
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs  	0
worth every penny	1
ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church  	1
it was a drive to get there	0

better than new	1
excellent cast story line performances  	1
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset	0

everything is appalling  	0
good price	1
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time	1
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  	0
it is an insane game  	1
generous portions and great taste	1
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality	1
it was pretty gross	0
fantastic food	1
piece of junk	0
it was a waste of my money	0
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles	0
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didn't overwhelm the soup	1
it is a very well acted and done tv movie  	1
the acting is beyond abysmal  	0
voice recognition is tremendous	1
anyway i do not think i will go back there	0
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  	1
excellent product	1
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop	0
say bye bye to your tip lady	0
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor	0
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas	0
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well	1
then the film just dropped the ball  	0
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days	0
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods	0
excellent sound quality	1
each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious	1
definitely a bargain	1
graphics is far from the best part of the game  	0
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film  	0
2 thumbs up	1
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas	0
but then they came back cold	0
food was delicious	1
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving	1
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age  	1
the food was very good	1
as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it's frightening  	1
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression  	1
this place is disgusting	0
first  the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished  just plain yucky	0
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award  	1
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special	1
i love this bluetooth	1
i'd say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of m's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing	1
i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie  	0
after my phone got to be about a year old it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part	0
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me	0
overall a great experience	1
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced	1
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price	1
nice case feels good in your hands	1
the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce  	0
soyo technology sucks	0
con spotty service	0
i hate movies like that  	0
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldn't eat here again	0
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on	1
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus	1
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was  	1
battery has no life	0
don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support	0
great food and awesome service	1
i love this phone	1
really pleased with this product so far	1
the waitress and manager are so friendly	1
it's a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this  	0
seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on  	0
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied	1
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service	1
the ambiance was incredible	1
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses	0
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm	1
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean	1
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier	1
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew  	0
what a waste	0
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings	0
bad reception	0
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it	1
its a total package	1
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews	1
 anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot  	1
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome	0
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant	1
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me	0
this is hands down the best phone i've ever had	1
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever	0
great food and awesome service	1
nice docking station for home or work	1
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure  	0
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons	0
it is zillion times away from reality  	0
great bluetooth	1
even billy bob couldn't rise above the script which was worse  	0
it's a piece of crap	0
this place was such a nice surprise	1
this product is very high quality chinese crap	0
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts  	1
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  	0
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special	1
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder	1
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table	1
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10	1
doesn't hold charge	0
it was probably dirt	0
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible	0
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable  	1
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent	1
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far	1
everything stinks  	0
the transfers are very good  	1
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen  	0
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food	0
better than you'd expect	1
i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style sensitivities and treatments  	1
the lighting is awful  	0
i own 2 of these cases and would order another	1
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it	1
the service was a little slow  considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace	0
good prices	1
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors  	0
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america  	0
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue  	1
the commercials are the most misleading	0
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing	0
i've had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho	0
it was too predictable even for a chick flick  	0
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car	1
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race  	1
i wasn't expecting oscar material but this  	0
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine	1
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers  	1
food quality has been horrible	0
all in all i can assure you i'll be back	1
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times  	0
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well	0
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal	0
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time  	1
it's a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver  	1
today the graphics are crap  	0
julian fellowes has triumphed again  	1
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem	0
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer	0
i highly recommend this device to everyone	1
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset	0
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again  	1
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve	1
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn't receive and place calls	0
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in	0
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	0
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	1
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film  	1
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip	1
better than new	1
really pleased with this product so far	1
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once	1
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful	1
unfortunately it did not work	0
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop	0
anyway i do not think i will go back there	0
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of	1
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone	0
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were  	0
fans of the genre will be in heaven  	1
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service	1
worthwhile	1
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  	1
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product	1
don't waste your money	0
buttons are too small	0
ordered burger rare came in we'll done	0
new battery works great in phone	1
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well	1
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value	1
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it	0

it deserves strong love  	1
only pros  large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough	1

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted  	1

the service was not up to par either	0
internet is excrutiatingly slow	0
the instruction manual is lacking	0
poor quality and service	0
i wouldn't return	0
the kids are annoying  	0
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot	1
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful	1
the service here is fair at best	0
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  	0
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player	0
the replacement died in a few weeks	0
the food is very good for your typical bar food	1
they work about 2 weeks then break	0

i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives	0
the patio seating was very comfortable	1
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone	1
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy	0
 with great sound effects and impressive special effects i can't recommend this movie enough  	1
the film lacks any real scares or tension  some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least  i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself  	0
it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie  	1
and the accents are absolutely abysmal  	0
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway	0
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money	1
the budget was evidently very limited  	0
avoid avoid avoid  	0
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's upandcoming	1
about half way through this film i started to dislike it  	0
appetite instantly gone	0

it definitely was not as good as my s11	1
i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem	1
as many people complained i found this headset's microphone was very weak	0
this device is great in several situations1	1
the football scenes at the end were perplexing  	0
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age  	1
both great	1
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
i won't try going back there even if it's empty	0
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it	1
nicest chinese restaurant i've been in a while	1
i used to talk on it for 1  1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying	0
i like armand assante  my cable company's summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again  	1
it's a piece of crap	0
the script is horrendously stupid  	0
battery is terrible	0
don't waste your money and time	0
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices	1
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot	1
i do not know if this was emilio estevez's directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye  	1
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion  	1
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  	1
i got food poisoning here at the buffet	0
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me	0
julian fellowes has triumphed again  	1
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other  	1
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly	1
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander  	1
the food is about on par with denny's which is to say not good at all	0
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace  	0
it will drive you barking mad  	0
i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie  	0
great product and price	1
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script  	1
it looked like a wonderful story  	1
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  	0
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen	1
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before  	0
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas	0
it's like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is  	1
then as if i hadn't wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check	0

similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late	0

this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face  	1
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic  	0
iam very pleased with my purchase	1
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use	0
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie  	0
good product good seller	1
definitely will come back here again	1
and i just love the colors	1
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night  highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 	1

this battery is an excellent bargain	1
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations  	1

the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible	0
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased	1

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet	0
the service was a bit lacking	0
very easy to use	1

they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with  	1
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat	1
very friendly staff	1
they are so cool	1
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture  	0
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert	0
i great reception all the time	1
great for ipods too	1
also the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player	0
the burrittos blah	0
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i	0
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart  	1
it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy  	0
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point	0
the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it  	0
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed	0
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order	0
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it  	1
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with	1
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman	1
i am glad i purchased it	1
razr battery  good buy	1
everything from acting to cinematography was solid  	1
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr	0

plus it's only 8 bucks	1
this place was such a nice surprise	1
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor pizza hut coupons	0
i don't like this nokia either	0
great time  family dinner on a sunday night	1
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love  	1

please dont waste your money	0
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale  	1
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me	0
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
it felt too light and tinny	0
best tacos in town by far	1
i love this bluetooth	1
it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time  	1
there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit  	0
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda	0
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything  	1
totally believable  	1
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless	0
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen  	1
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good	1
and quite honestly often its not very good  	0
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with  	1
unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening	0
all i have to say is the food was amazing	1
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film  	1
all in all i can assure you i'll be back	1
unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening	0
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection	1

if you don't find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone	0
this phone might well be the worst i've ever had in any brand	0
i was not impressed by this product	0
the food is very good for your typical bar food	1
great product for the price	1
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews	1

three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen  	1

the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly	1
comfort for our whole family	1
which are small and not worth the price	0
i didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes  	1
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  	0
i didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort	0
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that	0
nothing special	0
2 thumbs up to this seller	1
later i found myself lost in the power of the film  	1
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration	0
the cast is always entertaining as usual  	1
we've tried to like this place but after 10 times i think we're done with them	0
and the accents are absolutely abysmal  	0
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love	1

very windresistant	1
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching	1
it was packed	0
the range is very decent i've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues	1
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever  	1
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality	0
i will never forget it now  	1
definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness  	1
it's like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
i really liked that  	1
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid  	0
a greasy unhealthy meal	0
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film  it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation  	0
this scene is very strong and unpleasant  	0
actually the graphics were good at the time  	1
it was absolutely amazing	1

we could not believe how dirty the oysters were	0
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style	0

the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  	0
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious	1

we loved the place	1
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before  	0

the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked	0

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake	0
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone	0
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking	0
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage	0
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors  	0
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1

this is an extraordinary film  	1
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me	0

both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract  	1

poorly contstruct hinge	0
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it	1
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach	0
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care	1
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts  	1
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving	1
either way it sucks  	0
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie  	1
didn't laugh or even smile once  	0
not good enough for the price	0
attempting artiness with black  white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed  became even more ridiculous  as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent  	0
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful	1
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more	0
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical  	0
this is not moviemaking  	0
horrible phone	0
filmiing was less expansive  	0
great earpiece	1
as for the mains also uninspired	0
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard  	1
there were too many close ups  	0
watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show  	0
it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films  	0
bad characters bad story and bad acting  	0
do not buy if you want to use the holster	0
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful	0
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal	1

it's like a really sexy party in your mouth where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party	1
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy  	0
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago  	1
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes	0
then as if i hadn't wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check	0
lousy product	0
i wouldn't recommend buying this product	0
the soundtrack wasn't terrible either  	1
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first	0
waiter was a jerk	0
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was  	1
you'll love it  	1
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great	1
that one didn't work either	0
it's a great place and i highly recommend it	1
after one bite i was hooked	1
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere  	0
buttons are too small	0
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted  	0
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	0
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy	0
the staff are great the ambiance is great	1
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this  	1
amazon sucks	0
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid  	0
will not be back	0
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork	0
poorly contstruct hinge	0
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles	1

love it great armband	1

any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one	0

the movie showed a lot of florida at it's best made it look very appealing  	1
is pretty funny  	1
better than new	1
i wouldnt see this movie again for free  	0
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film  it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation  	0
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next  	1
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot	1
again lame  	0
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family	1
it's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg	0
total waste of time	0
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous	1
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent	1
i wouldnt see this movie again for free  	0
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts  	0
the chefs were friendly and did a good job	1
the nachos are a must have	1
pretty cool i would say	1
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well	1
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie  	0
ambience is perfect	1
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note i'd love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones  	1
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy  	1
i will not be eating there again	0
this is actually a very smart movie  	1
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well	0
piece of trash	0
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible	0
the menu is always changing food quality is going down  service is extremely slow	0
too bad you have to pay up to  a month for the service	0
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander  	1
once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place	1
anne heche was utterly convincing  	1
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear	1
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him	1
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives  	1
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc	0
that company is a joke	0
buy it play it enjoy it love it  	1
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie  	1
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion  	1
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed	0
no i'm going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it	0
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miner's daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire  	1
big disappointment with calendar sync	0
if you don't find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone	0
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
the film's dialogue is natural real to life  	1
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions  	1
this is infuriating	0
but it picked up speed and got right to the point  	1
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something	1
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player	0
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me	1
works well	1
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away	1
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive	1
could not get strong enough signal	0
total brunch fail	0
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor	0
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1
say bye bye to your tip lady	0
real sushi lovers let's be honest  yama is not that good	0
the dialogue is atrocious  	0
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	1
disappointing experience	0
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it	0
you can find better movies at youtube  	0
nice spicy and tender	1
i was very disappointed	0

an awesome new look for fall 2000	1
if you're not familiar check it out	1
i don't think i've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much  	0
the design is very good4	1
good servicecheck	1
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution	0
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera  	1
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict  	0
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years  	1
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time  	0
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor	1
can't upload ringtones from a third party	0
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good	1
the phone is sturdy and waterproof	1
perfect for the ps3	1
lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age  	0
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today	0
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed	1
superb phone on a great network	1
the warm beer didn't help	0
so bad  	0
also great directing and photography  	1
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs	0
i give it 2 thumbs down	0
greatno problems at all	1
this is a stunning movie  	1
don't waste your  on this one	0
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area	1
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review  	0
i just saw this film and i recommend it  	1
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly	0
hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood  	1
i believe that pitch black was done well  	1
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality	0
i never come again	0
the burger had absolutely no flavor  the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor	0
keep up the good work amazon	1
always a pleasure dealing with him	1
excellent short film  	1
delete this film from your mind  	0
the directing seems too pretentious  	0
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try  	1
so bad  	0
buyerbe very careful	0
this one just fails to create any real suspense  	0
if you haven't gone here go now	1
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting	1
i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
this was my first time and i can't wait until the next	1
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it	0
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot	1
i would not recommend this place	0
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything  	1
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic  a real treat	1
very good product well made	1
the food came out at a good pace	1
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested	1
not even good for camp value  	0
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  	0
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it  	1
all i have to say is the food was amazing	1
i never walked out of a movie faster  	0
buy it play it enjoy it love it  	1
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden	0
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch	0
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome	0
i found the product to be easy to set up and use	1
not worth it	0
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  	0
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic  	0
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase	1
couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal	1
excellently produced by one of scifi's best producers scot vandiver   	1
the phone loads super	1
they know how to make them here	1
awesome device	1
waitress was a little slow in service	0
don't waste your money	0
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this  	0
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset	0
i don't think you will be disappointed  	1
what a big waste of time	0
it was quite comfortable in the ear	1
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations it's an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience  	1
honeslty it didn't taste that fresh	0
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly	0
i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style sensitivities and treatments  	1
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons  	0
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good	1
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one	0
this place is like chipotle but better	1
as many people complained i found this headset's microphone was very weak	0
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other  	1
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them	1
great hands free device	1
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork	0
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show  	1
does everything it should and more	1
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better	1
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes	0
this is a great deal	1
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again	0
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous  	1
those burgers were amazing	1
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign	0
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source	1
excellent dualpurpose headset	1
nice spicy and tender	1
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid 750 to see this crap  	0
it quit working after i'd used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset i've ever owned	1
 both the hot  sour  the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars	1
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script  	1
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago	1
i great reception all the time	1
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset	0
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not	0
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's upandcoming	1
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed  	0
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating  	1
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever	0
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal	1
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style	0
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract  	1
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it	1
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film  	1
it was a waste of my money	0
i'm still trying to get over how bad it was  	0
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser	1
1 it works  2 it is comfortable	1
the food was excellent and service was very good	1
actually the graphics were good at the time  	1
there is a brilliant twist ending  	1
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasn't food	0
i can't wait to go back	1
now this dish was quite flavourful	1
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high	1
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating	0
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear	0
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid	1
very disappointed	0
hands down my favorite italian restaurant	1
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it	1
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap  	0
i believe that pitch black was done well  	1
great choice	1
great pizza and salads	1
service is also cute	1
on the up side their cafe serves really good food	1
they have great dinners	1
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry	0
he really didn't seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests  	0
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad	0
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  	1
lots of holes in the script  	0
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait	0
the camera really likes her in this movie  	1
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well	1
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service	1
great pork sandwich	1
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service	1
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star  	1
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell  	0
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic	1
i think not again	0
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers	1
i probably won't be back to be honest	0
unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening	0
the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling  	0
will not be back	0
all three broke within two months of use	0

the presentation of the food was awful	0
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits	0

didn't laugh or even smile once  	0
i can say that the desserts were yummy	1

this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture  	0
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations it's an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience  	1

this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it  	1
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first	0
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes	1
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures  	0
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it	0
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor	1
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount	1

i don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt	0
do not waste your money here	0
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked	0

the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget  	1
