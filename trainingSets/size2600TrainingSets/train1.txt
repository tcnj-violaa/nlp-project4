i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago  	1
battery life is also great	1
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander  	1
poor talk time performance	0
totally believable  	1

defective crap	0
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat	0
warning  stay away	0
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint	0
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon  	1
couldn't figure it out	0
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy  	1
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby	1

and it was way to expensive	0
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching	1
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner	1

steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no	0
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby	1
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  	1
comfort for our whole family	1
everything was perfect the night we were in	1
and the sound quality is great	1

in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release  	0
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland	0
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching	1
it's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage  	0

i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip	1
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud	1

really ugly	0
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving  	0
the sets are so bad they wouldn't look out of place on a thunderbirds episode  	0
the best part about nurse betty is it's unpredictability  	1
it's like a really sexy party in your mouth where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party	1
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  	0
seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on  	0
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that	1
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles	1
really good product	1
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution	0

great phone	1
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry  	1
it's fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable	1
the shipping time was also very quick	1
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse  	1
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off  	0
honeslty it didn't taste that fresh	0
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos	1
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase	1
worse there's an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	0
overall i wasn't very impressed with noca	0
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it  	1
very disappointing	0
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations it's an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience  	1
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier	1
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film  	1
looks great and is strong	1
having trouble with volume	0
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public  	0
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is  	0
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful	1
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call	0
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids  	1
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr	0
the script is¬Öwas there a script  	0
unfortunately any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script  	0
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone	0
there are some generally great things in it  	1
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left	0
later i found myself lost in the power of the film  	1
never going back	0

none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly	0
very very fun chef	1
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too	1
it's a great place and i highly recommend it	1
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude	1
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame  	1
the noise shield is incrediable	1
best tater tots in the southwest	1
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	0
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list	0
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was  	1

even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying	0
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way  	1
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's  	1
for service i give them no stars	0
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste	1
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work wellwell this one works great	1
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced	0
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen	1
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well	1
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume	0
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans  	1
the film looks cheap and bland  	0
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	0
this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon	0
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters  	0
amazon sucks	0
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off	0
my fianc√© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away	1
my girlfriend's veal was very bad	0
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives	0
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it	0
i'd say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of m's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing	1
i'm still infatuated with this phone	1
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i	0
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  	0
best i've found so far  i've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using	1
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that i've tried so far and they're all good	1

my first visit to hiro was a delight	1
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning	1

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right	1
my girlfriend's veal was very bad	0
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad  	0

it's a feelgood film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema  	1
fast service	1
i wasn't expecting oscar material but this  	0
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers	0

the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going  	1
the food was terrible	0
won't go back	0
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing	1
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery  	0
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant	1

the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing	0
i mean this in a terrible way  	0
the food is very good for your typical bar food	1
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well	0
the script is horrendously stupid  	0
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc	0
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 	1
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was  	1

very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist  	0
they were excellent	1
service is quick and friendly	1
i was very disappointed	0
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time  	1
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it	0

the delivery was on time	1
how stupid is that	0
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing  	1
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome	0
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer	0

all in all i'm quite satisfied with this purchase	1
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity  	0
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested	1
needless to say i wasted my money	0
love this headset	1
if there is a wind it is completely useless	0
unfortunately 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain  	0

it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles	1
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  	1
this place was such a nice surprise	1
a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing  	1

the transfers are very good  	1
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one	0

this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre  	1

that company is a joke	0
the service was poor and thats being nice	0
it was just too horrible  	0
these are the nicest restaurant owners i've ever come across	1
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  	1
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch  	1
the nachos are a must have	1
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place	1

i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls  	1
eclectic selection	1
the ri style calamari was a joke	0
awsome device works great	1

makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when i'm not wearing it	0
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network	0
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up  	0
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense  	0
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses	0
i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style sensitivities and treatments  	1
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone  	0
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again	0
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it	0
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish	0

the dialogue is atrocious  	0
would not reccommend	0
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable	1
very good stuff for the price	1
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them	0
the worst was the salmon sashimi	0
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning  	0
very disappointing	0
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries	0
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue  	1
hell no will i go back	0
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again  	1

not recommended  	0
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture  	0
ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church  	1
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old  	1
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed	0
poor quality	0
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget	1

this place lacked style	0
will not be back	0
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar	0

this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably  	0
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great	1
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it	1
i'm very disappointed with my decision	0
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film  	1
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad  	0
very good product well made	1

this was one of the worst films i have ever seen  	0
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible	0
what a great double cheeseburger	1
the burrittos blah	0

the result is a film that just don't look right  	0
i also had to taste my mom's multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious	1
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  	0

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard  	1
also the story and acting were weak  	0

i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great	1
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage	0
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in	0
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
but this movie really got to me  	1
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem	0
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love	1
i've missed numerous calls because of this reason	0
there is no real plot  	0
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only	0
i still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones we just obviously don't share enough dna to copy the design over to humans	0
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers	1
in short don't bother with this movie  	0
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food	0

unfortunately it did not work	0
a pretty good product	1
in short  this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film  	0
this is such a fun and funny movie  	1
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables	0
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop  	1
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch  	1
she's poised and amazing  	1
i won't try going back there even if it's empty	0
someone shouldve invented this sooner	1
piece of junk	0
the acting as you'd expect from this cast is top notch  	1
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen	1
the jerky camera movements were also annoying  	0
the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite  	0
i'm probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it	0
i was deeply impressed with the character he played  	1
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters  	1
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miner's daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire  	1
after two i felt disgusting	0
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach	0
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's upandcoming	1
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data	0
never had anything to complain about here	1
it has all the features i want	1
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service	1
it's too bad the food is so damn generic	0
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me	0
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
poor voice clarity	0
and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you  the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors  	0
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop  	1
2 thumbs up	1
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	0
it's a feelgood film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema  	1

that's rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good	1
i literally vomited while watching this film  	0
a film not easily forgotten  	1
do not waste your money here	0
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable  	0
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time  	0
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon	0
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food	0
i found the product to be easy to set up and use	1
don't waste your  on this one	0
portable and it works	1
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine	1
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age  	1
not a good bargain	0
today the graphics are crap  	0
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza	1
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas	0
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc	1
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is  	1
overpriced for what you are getting	0
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine  	1
poor quality	0
good product good seller	1

the death row scenes were entirely unmoving  	0
it wasn't busy at all and now we know why	0
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script  	1
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave  	1
we will not be coming back	0
and it was way to expensive	0
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good	1
i'd say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of m's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing	1
the cast was great  	1
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  	1
being a 90's child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons  	1
this place was such a nice surprise	1
it will drive you barking mad  	0
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing	1
will order from them again	1
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area	1
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost  	1
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus  	0
i can assure you that you won't be disappointed	1
 both the hot  sour  the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars	1
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good  	1
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time  	1
the film looks cheap and bland  	0
awsome device works great	1
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative  	0
excellently produced by one of scifi's best producers scot vandiver   	1

this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times  	0
the waitress and manager are so friendly	1
she carries the movie well  	1
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm	0
the suspense builders were good  just cross the line from g to pg  	1
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isn't it	0
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didn't expect more tip than that	1

setup went very smoothly	1
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked	0
also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design  costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar  	1
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  	0
it is very comfortable on the ear	1
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways	1

lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists  	1

do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish	0
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character  	1
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price	1

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means	0
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food	0
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price	1
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful	1
i don't know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories  	1

the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree	1
the case is great and works fine with the 680	1

this place deserves no stars	0
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes  	0
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing	0
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love  	1
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series  	1
crisp and clear	1
piece of trash	0
don't buy it	0
the camera really likes her in this movie  	1
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  	0
that's rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good	1
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good	1
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad	0
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives	0
great for the jawbone	1
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible	0
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding	1
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless	0
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad  	0
50 down the drain	0
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake	0
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films  	1
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me  	1
the ambiance isn't much better	0
great choice	1
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines  	0
rip off over charge shipping	0
you could drive a semi truck into these holes  	0
painful on the ear	0
must have been an off night at this place	0
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles  	1
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldn't produce my receipt i was out of luck	0

i could barely stomach the meal but didn't complain because it was a business lunch	0
the food is good	1
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings	0
thoroughly disappointed	0
its a total package	1
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money	1
plus with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job  	1
i only used it two days and it wasn't always easy to hear with	0
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round  	0
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is  	0
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good  	0
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying	0
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries	0
new battery works great in phone	1
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food	0
good case excellent value	1
just spicy enough perfect actually	1

def coming back to bowl next time	1
i went to bachi burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed	1
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love  	1
appetite instantly gone	0
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed	1
it's a sad movie but very good  	1
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well	1
the menu is always changing food quality is going down  service is extremely slow	0
overall a great experience	1
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid	1
nice case feels good in your hands	1
for that it's worth checking out  	1
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  	1
it definitely was not as good as my s11	1
the staff are great the ambiance is great	1
top line don't waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes  	0

this is an unbelievable bargain	1
it looked like a wonderful story  	1
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar	0
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order	0
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service	1
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy  	0
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic	1
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all  	0
it was pretty gross	0
just what i wanted	1
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you won't be disappointed	1
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off	0
a fly was in my apple juice a fly	0
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixar's cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories  	1
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try	1
very disappointed	0
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa  	1
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house	0
if the food isn't bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world's worstannoying drunk people	0
 don't waste your time  	0
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him	1
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus  	0
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this  bad idea we both hated it  	0
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa  is that the new phone on tv	1

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives  	1
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible	0
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold	0
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo	1
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened	0
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry	0
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly	0
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot	1
i don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt	0
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick  	0
it does everything the description said it would	1
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone	0
i advise you to look out for it  	1
this is not moviemaking  	0
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product	1
very windresistant	1
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and i'm glad i did	1
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve	1

the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome	0
the burger is good beef cooked just right	1
it was so boring  	0
my friend did not like his bloody mary	0
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria	1
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse	0
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert	0
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten	0
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed	0
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it	0
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome	0
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous  	1
none of it works just don't buy it	0
excellent performance  	1
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated	1
the turkey and roast beef were bland	0
i usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight  doesn't mess up my hair	1
good prices	1
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	1
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i	1
bad fit way too big	0
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however it's not	1
interesting decor	1
hated it  	0
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking	0
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars	0
the design is very good4	1
the service here is fair at best	0
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater	0
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day	0
it's like a really sexy party in your mouth where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party	1
plug was the wrong size	0
damn good steak	1
hitchcock is a great director  	1
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does	0
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything	0
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film  	1
i've bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these	0
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family	1
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc	1
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real  	1
this film has no redeeming features  	0
would not reccommend	0
the waitress and manager are so friendly	1
they dropped more than the ball	0
great price too	1
but i thought his acting was skilled  	1
he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money  	0
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  	0
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order	0
very comfortable	1
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature	1
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked	0
furthermore you can't even find hours of operation on the website	0
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip	1
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat	0
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i don't care how cool it looks if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless	0
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good	1
buy it play it enjoy it love it  	1
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew  	0
i own 2 of these cases and would order another	1
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor	1
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white lowbudget original  	1
it was too predictable even for a chick flick  	0
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying	0
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use	0
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i won't spoil it  	1
this place is like chipotle but better	1
blue ant is easy to use	1
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast  	0
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen	1
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle  	1
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip	1
brilliance indeed  	1
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs  	0
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's upandcoming	1
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had	1
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside	1
also difficult to put oni'd recommend avoiding this product	0

the script is a big flawed mess  	0
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when i'm not wearing it	0
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives	0
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds	0
the patio seating was very comfortable	1
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well	1
not good enough for the price	0
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles	0
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded  	0
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job  	1
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is  	0
i'm a bit disappointed	0
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  	1
the service was meh	0
the menu is always changing food quality is going down  service is extremely slow	0
buttons are too small	0
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations  	1
this movie is terrible  	0
the cast was great  	1

the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem  	1
food quality has been horrible	0
waiter was a jerk	0
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable  	0

a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever  	0
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone	0
that was funny  	1
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed	0
audio quality is poor very poor	0
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus	1
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that i've got it i couldn't be happier	1
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas	0
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1
1010  	1
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year	1
dont waste your money	0
great movie  	1
everything about this product is wrongfirst	0
would not go back	0
big disappointment with calendar sync	0
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic  	1
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot	1
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film  	1
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable  	0
it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is	0
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute	1
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	0
it's fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable	1
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar	0
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20  left in the morning	0
honeslty it didn't taste that fresh	0
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked	0
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen  	1
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great	0
i found the product to be easy to set up and use	1
i just wanted to leave	0
go rent it  	1
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when i'm not wearing it	0
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews	1
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed	0
this was my first time and i can't wait until the next	1
battery life is real good	1
watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show  	0
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast	1
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible	0
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal	0
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible	0
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap	0
i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie  	0
all three broke within two months of use	0
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked	1
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up	1
defective crap	0
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls  	1
someone shouldve invented this sooner	1
i was seated immediately	1
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film  	1
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him	1
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is  	1
excellently produced by one of scifi's best producers scot vandiver   	1
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy  	1
it was just not a fun experience	1
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once	0
i would not recommend this place	0
also makes it easier to hold on to	1
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines  	0
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight	1
excellent product for the price	1
great food	1

low quality	0
it's close to my house it's lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food	1

in a word it is embarrassing  	0
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something	0
it didn't charge for me	0
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased	1
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great	1
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more	0
i would recommend saving room for this	1
now this is a movie i really dislike  	0
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it  	0
 the food is rich so order accordingly	1
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby	1
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0
it's a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this  	0
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides	0
unfortunately any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script  	0
fast service	1
which are small and not worth the price	0
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art  	1
this is hands down the best phone i've ever had	1
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before  	0
the character developments also lacked in depth  	0
terrible management	0
great movie  	1
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day	0
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review  	0
i wouldn't return	0
the bt headset was such a disapoinment	0
and those baby owls were adorable  	1
appetite instantly gone	0
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is  	0
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it	0
it was pretty gross	0
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section	1
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly	0
of course the acting is blah  	0
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face  	1
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed	1
it's not hard to make a decent hamburger	0
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery	0
doesn't do the job	0
if someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart	0
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place	0
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing  	0
julian fellowes has triumphed again  	1
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is  	0
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking  	1
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i don't want to waste time on bad reviewing i'll leave it at that	0
my first visit to hiro was a delight	1
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse	0
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists  	1
one of the worst shows of all time  	0
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked	0
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing	0
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods	0
thank you for such great service	1
i love the camera it's really pretty good quality	1
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again	0
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place	1
it is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it	1
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot  	0
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing	0
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care	1
avoid avoid avoid  	0
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it  	1

i wish i could enter negative values admins  	0
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place  	0
what a big waste of time	0
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived	0
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food	0
its not user friendly	0
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film  	1
very comfortable	1
none of it works just don't buy it	0
i'll be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason	0
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing	0
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot	1
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear	0
i am more than happy with this product	1
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn't receive and place calls	0
watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show  	0
it was just too horrible  	0
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time i'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago	1
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous	1
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen  	1
the service was not up to par either	0
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom  	0
very windresistant	1
i want my money back	0
very dissapointing performance	0
phenomenal food service and ambiance	1
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch  	1
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it	0
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience  	0
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers	0
awesome device	1
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use	1
i'd like to return it	0
if it were possible to give them zero stars they'd have it	0

when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing	0
works well	1
lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age  	0
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic  a real treat	1
what a big waste of time	0
needless to say i won't be going back anytime soon	0
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy  	1
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested	1
great phone	1
it's a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver  	1
thanks good a movie like this was done and released  	1
having trouble with volume	0
first of all it doesn't wear well	0
i can't believe there's even a sequel to this  	0
i wasn't the least bit interested  	0
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas	0
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me	1
couldn't use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas	0
fans of the genre will be in heaven  	1
i would have given no star if i was able	0
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget  	1
worst foodservice i've had in a while	0
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow	1
seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on  	0
like the other reviewer said you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again	0
yet i enjoy watching it  	1
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  	0
2 times  very bad customer service 	0
very bad experience	0
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next  	1
i was not impressed by this product	0
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features  	1
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike  	1
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly	0
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters  	1
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters	1
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes	1
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles	1
great price too	1
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other  	1
i could barely stomach the meal but didn't complain because it was a business lunch	0
we aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just don't get itdefinitely lost the love after this one	0
 i love it  	1
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism  	1
terrible service	0
very nice and relaxing late night viewing  	1
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design	0
horrible phone	0
reception is terrible and full of static	0
nice spicy and tender	1
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film  	1
it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is	0
three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen  	1
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant	1
timely shipment and quality product	1
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything	0
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive	1
don't waste your money and time	0
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door	0
i've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me	1
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back  	0
performed awful  muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call	0
another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after  	0
great sound and service	1
bad reception	0
what a waste of money and time	0
i rather enjoyed it  	1
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  	0
i don't think you will be disappointed  	1
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone	0
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design	0
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing	0
and it was way to expensive	0
the waitresses are very friendly	1
the selection of food was not the best	0
no buyers remorse on this one	0
very easy to use	1
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming	1
save your money i've had this item for 11 months now	0
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron	0
it's like a really sexy party in your mouth where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party	1
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking  	1
doesn't last long	0
great phone	1
i'm a bit disappointed	0
i don't know what the big deal is about this place but i won't be back ya'all	0
the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling  	0
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device	0
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that i've got it i couldn't be happier	1
overall a great experience	1
on the up side their cafe serves really good food	1
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor	0
not worth it	0
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste	1
don't bother  go to the store	0
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us	0
i love this bluetooth	1
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days	0
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious	1
i won't try going back there even if it's empty	0
1 it works  2 it is comfortable	1
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0

all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing	0
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone	0
this is a good joint	1
excellent performance  	1
very good quality though	1
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i won't be going back	0
terrible management	0
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected	1
i hope this place sticks around	1
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what i've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here	1
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options	1
it's a feelgood film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema  	1
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver	1
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming	1
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic  	0
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack	0
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything	0
overall i don't think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too	0
this is an extraordinary film  	1
it is worth the drive	1
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone	0
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all  	0
the food is about on par with denny's which is to say not good at all	0
there is no real plot  	0
this isn't a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment	1
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless	0
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily	0
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection	1
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat	0
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place	0
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it	1
 anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot  	1
as for the mains also uninspired	0
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch  	1
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional	1
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had	1
horrible  	0
again no plot at all  	0
the story itself is just predictable and lazy  	0
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees	0
this fixes all the problems	1
excellent product for the price	1
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i won't be going back	0
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed  	0
i was not impressed by this product	0
sweetest phone	1
the poor actors  	0
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well	0
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star  	1
all in all i can assure you i'll be back	1
wow loved this place	1
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too  	0
i think not again	0
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded  	0
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it	0
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it  	1
it was pretty gross	0
very clear quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset	1
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined	0
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper	1
worst customer service	0
it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work  	1
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone	1
they will customize your order any way you'd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it	1
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart  	1
it looked like a wonderful story  	1
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end	1
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well	1
food was good service was good prices were good	1
the concert sequences just sucked  	0
don't waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film  	0
they work about 2 weeks then break	0
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only	0
great product and price	1
i would recommend this	1
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid	1
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product	0
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does	0
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up	1
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character  	1
buy a different phone  but not this	0
i thought it was bad  	0
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts	0
i have read other's reviews here but i haven't had any problem with it	1
a standout scene  	1
overall i like there food and the service	1
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award  	1
thank you for wasting my money	0
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair	0
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life  	0
this place was such a nice surprise	1
i would have given no star if i was able	0
the buttons for on and off are bad	0
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste	0
this is a great deal	1
definitely will come back here again	1
you wont regret it  	1
thank you for wasting my money	0
bluetooth range is good  a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch	1
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous	0
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas	0
this show is made for americans  it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere  	0
works good	1
what the hell kind of crap is that  	0
food was so gooodd	1
the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite  	0
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well	1
i didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes  	1
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today  	1
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre  	1
awesome device	1
so they performed	1
it's a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect  	1
this is actually a very smart movie  	1
i don't think i'll be running back to carly's anytime soon for food	0
would recommend this item	1
it'll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix	1
we were promptly greeted and seated	1
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly	0
not too screamy not to masculine but just right  	1
we won't be going back	0
the only place good for this film is in the garbage  	0
now i know that i made a wise decision	1
amazon sucks	0
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well	1
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm	1
left very frustrated	0
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  	0
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor	0
the service was a bit lacking	0
i love this place	1
delicious	1
perfect for the ps3	1
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care  	1
the replacement died in a few weeks	0
i hate writing bad reviews about films  especially those in which i really like the star  but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it  	0
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service	1
this battery is an excellent bargain	1
we waited for forty five minutes in vain	0
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this	0
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two	0
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service	0
it's close to my house it's lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food	1
spend your money elsewhere	0
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint	1
it isn't even an achievement as a sobadit'sgood or sobadit'smemorable movie  	0
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  	0
nothing at all to recommend  	0
it doesn't make you look cool	0
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad	0
leopard print is wonderfully wild	1
the soundtrack wasn't terrible either  	1
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert	0
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda	0
feelings thoughtsgabriel's discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal  	1
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense  	0
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here  	0
the burger is good beef cooked just right	1
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap  	0
it has all the features i want	1
excellent product for the price	1
highly entertaining at all angles  	1
 anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot  	1
not a good bargain	0
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing	0
service is quick and friendly	1
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery  	0
battery life is real good	1
the suspense builders were good  just cross the line from g to pg  	1
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm	1
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry	0
all in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money  	0
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well	0
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807	0
raw and sublimely moving  	1
the best part about nurse betty is it's unpredictability  	1
i went to bachi burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed	1
couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal	1
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers	1
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts	0
not even good for camp value  	0
freezes frequently4	0
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise	0
what a mistake that was	0
thanks good a movie like this was done and released  	1
i got food poisoning here at the buffet	0
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part  	0
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything i've tried gets my seal of approval	1
you can watch them preparing the delicious food	1
good audio quality	1
 down the drain because of a weak snap	0
reception is terrible and full of static	0
i liked it  	1
i won't say any more  i don't like spoilers so i don't want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time  	1
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history  	1
nice spicy and tender	1
internet is excrutiatingly slow	0
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again	1
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk	0
the soundtrack sucked  	0
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807	0
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  	0
wasted two hours  	0
good transmit audio	1
the food is very good for your typical bar food	1
ryan's bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i won't be revisiting	0
avoid this establishment	0
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid 750 to see this crap  	0
terrible my car will not accept this cassette	0
it definitely was not as good as my s11	1
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1
i don't have to be an accountant to know i'm getting screwed	0
the poor actors  	0
it's a great place and i highly recommend it	1
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it	0
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk	0
the movie seemed a little slow at first  	0
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way	1
this movie is bad  	0
terrible product and waste of money	0
i just wanted to leave	0
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing  	0
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
and quite honestly often its not very good  	0
i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
everything stinks  	0
things that went wrong  they burned the saganaki	0
when i'm on this side of town this will definitely be a spot i'll hit up again	1
even billy bob couldn't rise above the script which was worse  	0
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child  	1
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me  	0
horrible had to switch 3 times	0
service sucks	0
we won't be going back	0
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 	1
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i won't be going back	0
never got it	0
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head  	1
but i thought his acting was skilled  	1
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better	1
warning  do not buy	0
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless	0
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however it's not	1
ordered a double cheeseburger  got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks	0
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc	1
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america  	0
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best	0
clear skype calls long battery life long range	1
three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen  	1
i never walked out of a movie faster  	0
it was too predictable even for a chick flick  	0
also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design  costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar  	1
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever	0
nothing special	0
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other  	1
the film's dialogue is natural real to life  	1
i received it quickly and it works great	1
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here	0
don't bother  go to the store	0
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service	0
the best phone in market 	1
you won't forget this movie  	1
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed	0
but then they came back cold	0

they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything i've tried gets my seal of approval	1
very tough and very short on flavor	0
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management	0
i'll definitely be in soon again	1
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended	1
really good product	1
ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church  	1
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good	1
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay	1
this is a good joint	1
my fianc√© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away	1
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity  	0
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant	1
good protection and does not make phone too bulky	1
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it  	1
we were promptly greeted and seated	1
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested	1
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone	1
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only	0
what did bother me was the slow service	0
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery	0
when i'm on this side of town this will definitely be a spot i'll hit up again	1
the delivery was on time	1
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film  	1
 they never brought a salad we asked for	0
it's the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher it's meanings  	1
it was a great phone	1
not my thing	0
give it a try you will be happy you did	1
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good	1
the service was not up to par either	0
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked	0
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only	0
my friend did not like his bloody mary	0
another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after  	0
long whiny and pointless  	0
the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right  	0
i will come back here every time i'm in vegas	1
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested	1
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary	0
needless to say i won't be going back anytime soon	0
this short film certainly pulls no punches  	0
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2	1
anyway i do not think i will go back there	0
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i don't want to waste time on bad reviewing i'll leave it at that	0
i hope this place sticks around	1
their chow mein is so good	1
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous	1
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious	1
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding  	0
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if you're looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further  	1
i'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere	0
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed	0
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed  	1
i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie  	0
timely shipment and quality product	1
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3	0
again lame  	0
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age  	1
the soundtrack sucked  	0
their steaks are 100 recommended	1
the story is also both funny and poignant at times  	1
def coming back to bowl next time	1
too politically correct  	0
needless to say we will never be back here again	0
great software for motorolas	1
absolutel junk	0
things that went wrong  they burned the saganaki	0
after charging overnight these batteries work great	1
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and i'm very happy with my purchase	1
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago  	1
i would not recommend this place	0
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside	1
love this product	1
delicious and i will absolutely be back	1
horrible phone	0
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty  	0
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options	1
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice	0
poor quality	0
it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is	0
i don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt	0
everything was perfect the night we were in	1
i'd rather eat airline food seriously	0
i used to talk on it for 1  1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying	0
for the price this was a great deal	1
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived	0
best headset ever	1
the han nan chicken was also very tasty	1
performed awful  muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call	0
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  	1
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in	0
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip	1
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes  	0
the service was meh	0
really pleased with this product so far	1
they refuse to refund or replace	0
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor	0
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product	1
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse	0
these are the nicest restaurant owners i've ever come across	1
this phone is pretty sturdy and i've never had any large problems with it	1
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job  	1
it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'  	0
either way it sucks  	0
as for the service i thought it was good	1
couldn't figure it out	0
this is actually a very smart movie  	1
