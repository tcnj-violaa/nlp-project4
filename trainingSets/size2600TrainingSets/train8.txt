brilliant  	1
bluetooth range is good  a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch	1
don't do it	0
excellent starter wireless headset	0
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous	1
which are small and not worth the price	0
the food came out at a good pace	1
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude	1
real sushi lovers let's be honest  yama is not that good	0
cute quaint simple honest	1
rude  inconsiderate management	0
i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie  	0
you can find better movies at youtube  	0
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money	1
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good	1
razr battery  good buy	1
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are	1
we'd definitely go back here again	1
50 down the drain	0
it just blew  	0
filmiing was less expansive  	0
buyerbe very careful	0
i love this phone	1
someone shouldve invented this sooner	1
last time buying from you	0
portable and it works	1
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good	1
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phone's autoanswer	1
bad fit way too big	0
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  	0
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase	1
if it were possible to give them zero stars they'd have it	0
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them	1
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable	1
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure  	0
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad	0
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way	1
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective  	1
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently	0
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute	1
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding	1
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc	1
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it  	1
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films  	1
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table	1
you wont regret it  	1
now i know that i made a wise decision	1
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid  	0
and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you  the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors  	0
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off	0
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other  	1
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  	0
mishima is extremely uninteresting  	0
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered	0
ordered a double cheeseburger  got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks	0
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what i've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here	1
i also had to taste my mom's multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious	1
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever	0
and the drinks are weak people	0
restored my phone to like new performance	1
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try  	1
clear crisp sound	1
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and i took a good two hours to fully recover  	0
food was good service was good prices were good	1
it really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down	0
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff	1
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things	0
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee	0
best tacos in town by far	1
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear	0
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent	1
i've had better bagels from the grocery store	0
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak i don't understand	0
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company	0
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate  	1
one of my favorite purchases ever	1
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since	0
i love their fries and their beans	1
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls  	1
what a big waste of time	0
pretty good beer selection too	1
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland	0
and then tragedy struck	0
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table	1
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games	0
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten	0
couldn't figure it out	0
everything about this movie is stupid  	0
overall this movie was cheap trash  	0
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when i'm not wearing it	0
i've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone i've had	1
would recommend this item	1
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse  	0
the service was a bit lacking	0
go rent it  	1
this is an unbelievable bargain	1
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay	1
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad  	0
avoid at all costs  	0
waste of money	0
lots of holes in the script  	0
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film  	0
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however it's not	1
i especially love the long battery life	1
it was quite comfortable in the ear	1
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good	1
the kids play area is nasty	0
went in for happy hour great list of wines	1
we waited for forty five minutes in vain	0
nice design and quality	1
also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design  costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar  	1
but it is entertaining nonetheless  	1
bad reception	0
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait	0
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems	1
he deserves 5 stars	1
this isn't a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment	1
the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right  	0
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money	1
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons  	0
i don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt	0
if the food isn't bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world's worstannoying drunk people	0
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone	0
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  	1
the characters are interesting and you really care for them  	1
go to place for gyros	1
say bye bye to your tip lady	0
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost  	1
great audio	1
i can't believe there's even a sequel to this  	0
great headset very impressed  h500	1
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip	1
product is exactly as described	1
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach	0
useless phone simply deaf	0
useless phone simply deaf	0
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely  	0
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isn't it	0
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws  	0
also great directing and photography  	1
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever  	1
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age  	1
the story line is just awful  	0
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff	1
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it	1
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros	0
the range is very decent i've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues	1
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic	1
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated	0
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced	0
i still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones we just obviously don't share enough dna to copy the design over to humans	0
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff	1
good servicecheck	1
never got it	0
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time i'm in vegas	1
i highly recommend this case	1
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show  	1
if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice  	1
so good i am going to have to review this place twice  once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night	1
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  	1
it's a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver  	1
another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model	0
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  	1
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off	1
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off	0
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next  	1
i could not recommend these more	0
we loved the place	1
this is a stunning movie  	1
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special	1
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle  	1
so far so good	1
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us	0
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miner's daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire  	1
it was not good	0
wasted two hours  	0
i wouldnt see this movie again for free  	0
won't go back	0
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased	1
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone	0
won't ever go here again	0
lightweight and works well	1
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good	0
the instruction manual is lacking	0
it just blew  	0
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it  	1
i've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it	1
easy to pair with my samsung cell	1
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons  	0
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew  	0
i gave it 5 stars then and i'm giving it 5 stars now	1
excellent starter wireless headset	0
i rate this movie 910  	1
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm	0
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens	0
i don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea	1
i'm not really sure how joey's was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine	0
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film  	1
after my phone got to be about a year old it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part	0
couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal	1
great movie  	1
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
 and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away  	0
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting	1
what a disappointment	0
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would	0
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it	0
but this movie is definitely a below average rent  	0
restored my phone to like new performance	1
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best	0
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options	1
the film's dialogue is natural real to life  	1
over rated	0
the chips and sals a here is amazing	1
poorly contstruct hinge	0
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch  	1
either way it sucks  	0
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small	0
awesome device	1
the concert sequences just sucked  	0
i used to talk on it for 1  1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying	0
join the club and get awesome offers via email	1
the football scenes at the end were perplexing  	0
it's a piece of crap	0
she carries the movie well  	1
doesn't do the job	0
great product for the price	1
i didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me	0
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas	1
do not buy if you want to use the holster	0
meredith m was better than all right  	1
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks  	0
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch  	1
 anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot  	1
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen  	1
his performance as awarded was stunning  	1
rip off over charge shipping	0
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular	1
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly  	1
it's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg	0
probably never coming back and wouldn't recommend it	0
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture  	0
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore	0
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product	1
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc  	0
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was  how it contained holes inconsistencies and  frankly  a whole lot of crap  and how horrid the dancing was  	0
i don't think you will be disappointed  	1
it's very slow  	0
i heart this place	1
even worse than ticker  	0
it's pure brilliance  	1
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem  	1
mic doesn't work	0
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money	0
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  	0
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing  	0
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one	0
i was deeply impressed with the character he played  	1
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility  	1
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews	1
works as described	1
the battery is completely useless to me	0
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race  	1
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for  	0
only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far	1
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing	1
you cant go wrong with any of the food here	1
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts	0
the food is about on par with denny's which is to say not good at all	0
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop	0
it's not hard to make a decent hamburger	0
they work about 2 weeks then break	0
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors i'd rather be using a disposable then this	0
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there	0
don't waste your time here	0
and it was way to expensive	0
everything was good and tasty	1
give it a try you will be happy you did	1
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child  	1
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected	0
what the hell kind of crap is that  	0
what a big waste of time	0
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldn't eat here again	0
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger	0
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery	1
better than expected	1
totally believable  	1
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore	0
the cast was great  	1
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics	1
brilliant  	1
not a good bargain	0
cumbersome design	0
you won't forget this movie  	1
i promise they won't disappoint	1
after all the rave reviews i couldn't wait to eat herewhat a disappointment	0
very funny  	1
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more  	0
raw and sublimely moving  	1
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee	0
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma	1
i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
does not work	0
avoid this establishment	0
 comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously	1
battery is terrible	0
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1
it was just not a fun experience	1
i gave it 5 stars then and i'm giving it 5 stars now	1
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger	0
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder  	0
i wish i could enter negative values admins  	0
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc	1
it felt too light and tinny	0
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far	1
i do not know if this was emilio estevez's directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye  	1
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike  	1
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0
you get what you pay for i guess	0
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed	0
once your food arrives it's meh	0
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent	1
each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious	1
superb phone on a great network	1
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting  	1
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew  	0
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression  	1
a bit predictable  	0
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil	0
this is not moviemaking  	0
it was just too horrible  	0
after one bite i was hooked	1
don't make the same mistake that i did and please don't buy this phone	0
i had strawberry tea which was good	1
the service was a bit lacking	0
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere	0
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio  so very delightful	1
the range is very decent i've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues	1
i was so insulted	0
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place	0
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good  	1
last time buying from you	0
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right	1
i can't use this case because the smell is disgusting	0
i was deeply impressed with the character he played  	1
all the bread is made inhouse	1
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters	1
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake  	0
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed	0
i also had to taste my mom's multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious	1
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them  	0
dee snider just plain sucks  	0
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed	0
it didn't work people can not hear me when i talk	0
very good lunch spot	1
this place is disgusting	0
 the food is rich so order accordingly	1
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week  but still lasts longer than thereplacement	0
i'll even say it again  this is torture  	0
they were goldencrispy and delicious	1
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order  all yummy for my tummy	1
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast  	1
waited 2 hours  never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did	0
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no	0
good transmit audio	1
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized  	1
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films  	1
the service was outshining  i definitely recommend the halibut	1
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty  	0
this film has no redeeming features  	0
the mic is great	1
doesn't hold charge	0
great software for motorolas	1
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them	0
i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence  	0
both great	1
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons	0
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it	1
this is a great deal	1
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty	1
extremely tasty	1
horrible  don't waste your time and money	0
if someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart	0
must have been an off night at this place	0
their steaks are 100 recommended	1
crisp and clear	1
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived	0
i never come again	0
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table	1
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing  	0
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation  	0
thoroughly disappointed	0
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off	0
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb  complex  	1
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts  	1
i wish i could enter negative values admins  	0
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff	1
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking  	1
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste	0
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known	0
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense  	0
doesn't work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working	0
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it  	1
they will customize your order any way you'd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it	1
it will drive you barking mad  	0
i went on motorola's website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again	0
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order  all yummy for my tummy	1
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone	0
great charger	1
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes	1
it's not what it says it is	0
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat	0
definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness  	1
it is shameful  	0
extremely tasty	1
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow	1
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse	0
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  	0
excellent product for the price	1
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it  	0
it's like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
phenomenal food service and ambiance	1
there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible  	0
and the drinks are weak people	0
dee snider just plain sucks  	0
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten	1
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service	1
i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull  	0
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap	0
the script iswas there a script  	0
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it	1
and those baby owls were adorable  	1
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place	1
freezes frequently4	0
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed	0
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was  	1
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very  appealing	0
if there is a wind it is completely useless	0
if you are reading this please don't go there	0
a standout scene  	1
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when i'm not wearing it	0
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award  	1
i will not return	0
great phone	1
meredith m was better than all right  	1
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner	1
ryan's bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i won't be revisiting	0
the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age  	1
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous	0
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i won't be back here because it is a convenient location	0
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were  	0
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value	1
this is an excellent film  	1
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair	0
very bad experience	0
we were promptly greeted and seated	1
very comfortable	1
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings	0
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow	1
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby	1

would not reccommend	0

the atmosphere here is fun	1
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good	1
talk about great customer service of course we will be back	1
not a good bargain	0
it's very slow  	0
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal	1
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing  	0
summary the witticisms weren't witty  	0
but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold  	1
we would recommend these to others	1
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	1
this is a stunning movie  	1
razr battery  good buy	1
no ear loop needed it's tiny and the sound is great	1
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for	0
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one	0

i'm happy about this purchase good quality and low price	1
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games	0
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game  	1
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	0
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film  	1
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc  	0

he's a national treasure  	1
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad	0

it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  	1
rip off over charge shipping	0
stay away from this store be careful	0
the mic is great	1

again lame  	0

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart  	1
don't bother  go to the store	0
the case is great and works fine with the 680	1
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner	1
horrible phone	0
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note i'd love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones  	1
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  	1
bad fit way too big	0
didn't laugh or even smile once  	0
it wasn't busy either also the building was freezing cold	0

highly recommended	1
service was fantastic	1
both do good jobs and are quite amusing  	1
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor	0

this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts	0
i don't have to be an accountant to know i'm getting screwed	0
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons  	0
regardless the film fails on most levels  	0
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way  	0
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds	0
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it	0
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor	0
what a mistake	0
after charging overnight these batteries work great	1
not good by any stretch of the imagination	0
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixar's cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories  	1
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes	1
overall i was not impressed and would not go back	0
lasted one day and then blew up	0
we won't be going back	0
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isn't it	0
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack	0
and there wasn't a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here  	1
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad	0
about half way through this film i started to dislike it  	0
the cast is always entertaining as usual  	1

bt50 battery junk	0
everything stinks  	0
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with  	1
they have great dinners	1
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger	0
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza	1
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine	1
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap	0
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears	0

very prompt service	1
there's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before	0
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless	0
this is a great phone	1
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal	1
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food	0
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite	1
crostini that came with the salad was stale	0
don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support	0
buy a different phone  but not this	0
can't upload ringtones from a third party	0
the script is horrendously stupid  	0
it's not what it says it is	0
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  	0
beautiful styling though	1
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor	0
still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow  	1
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means	0
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet	0
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid 750 to see this crap  	0
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show  	0
no i'm going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it	0
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic  	0
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	1
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent	1
i cannot make calls at certain places	0
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture  	0
not worth it	0
this is a great little item	1
excellent sound quality	1
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2	1
ryan's bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i won't be revisiting	0
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait	0
think of the film being like a dream  	1
i especially love the long battery life	1
someone shouldve invented this sooner	1
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids  	1
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	0
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating  	1
don't waste your  on this one	0
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop  	1
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm	0
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up	1
best tacos in town by far	1
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen  	0
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years  	1
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle  	1
overall this movie was cheap trash  	0
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair	0
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch	1
we've tried to like this place but after 10 times i think we're done with them	0
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks	0
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget  	1
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register	0
mediocre food	0
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side	0
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it  	1
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed	0
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense  	0
i hope this place sticks around	1
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing  	0
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking  	0
the staff are also very friendly and efficient	1
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers	1
i'd say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of m's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing	1
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  	0
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria	1
it was a great phone	1
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try  	1
2 thumbs up to this seller	1
the cast is always entertaining as usual  	1
just don't know why they were so slow	0
i great reception all the time	1
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game  	1
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate	0
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time  	1
food was so gooodd	1
i didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious	1
graphics is far from the best part of the game  	0
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation  	0
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips	1
not good for the money	0
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving	1
then the film just dropped the ball  	0
simple lightweight and great fit	1
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold  	1
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was  	1
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture  	0
excellent dualpurpose headset	1
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0
works great	1
it was too predictable even for a chick flick  	0
he was terrible	0
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was  how it contained holes inconsistencies and  frankly  a whole lot of crap  and how horrid the dancing was  	0
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it	0
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie  	1
the fries were great too	1
i liked the way dustin hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son  	1
sauce was tasteless	0
 the food is rich so order accordingly	1
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script  	0
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve	1
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network	0
for that it's worth checking out  	1
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3	0
sending it back	0
when i'm on this side of town this will definitely be a spot i'll hit up again	1
good servicecheck	1
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc	1
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end	1
i advise everyone do not be fooled	0
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up	0
horrible  	0
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back	1
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago	1
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste	0
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing	1
once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place	1
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely  	0
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish	1
was not happy	0
fast service	1
unfortunately any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script  	0
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case	1
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point	0
i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence  	0
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving  	0

it's a great place and i highly recommend it	1
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food	0
i won't be back	0
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie  	0
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job	0
this place is good	1
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games	0
if the food isn't bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world's worstannoying drunk people	0
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning	1
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips	1
great for the jawbone	1
his performance as awarded was stunning  	1

i wish i could enter negative values admins  	0
their research and development division obviously knows what they're doing	1
hands down my favorite italian restaurant	1
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist  	1
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables	0
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch	0
the battery works great	1
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears	1
hitchcock is a great director  	1
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case	1
crust is not good	0
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch  	1
food was great and so was the serivce	1
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006  	1
the story is also both funny and poignant at times  	1
food was really good and i got full petty fast	1

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him	1
the food amazing	1

excellent starter wireless headset	0
always a great time at dos gringos	1
i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style sensitivities and treatments  	1
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict  	0
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place	1
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it  	1
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show  	1
i wasted my little money with this earpiece	0
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked  	0
i like steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar	1
utter crap sound quality is terrible	0
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1
today is the second time i've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good	1
1010  	1
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside	1
uncomfortable in the ear don't use with lg vx9900 env	0
i'm glad this pretentious piece of s didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of québec  	0

food was really boring	0
they dropped more than the ball	0

i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics	1
nice design and quality	1
it was just too horrible  	0

everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good	1
we've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant	0
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace  	0
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price	1
terrible management	0
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty  	0
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series  	0

best tater tots in the southwest	1
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth  	1
the goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what flavor	1

this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it  	1
this is infuriating	0

the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined	0
long whiny and pointless  	0
love this headset	1
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end	1
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i	1
my phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand	1
as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening  	0
we were promptly greeted and seated	1
big disappointment with calendar sync	0
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise	0
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all  	0
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america  	0
it has been a winner for us	1
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are	1
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference  	1
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding	1
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing	1
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord  	1
keep up the good work amazon	1
great bluetooth	1
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul	1

i as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible	0
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back  	0
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there  	1
honeslty it didn't taste that fresh	0
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad  	0
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture  	1
however i needed some better instructions	0
but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold  	1
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1
the phone gets extremely hot	0
thoroughly disappointed	0
comfort for our whole family	1
they are so cool	1
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa  	1

i was very disappointed	0
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed	0

an awesome new look for fall 2000	1
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it	0
all in all i'm quite satisfied with this purchase	1
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head  	1
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated	1
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life  	0
i give it 2 thumbs down	0
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty	1
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration	0
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back	1
it's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage  	0
i love this device	1
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film  	1
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing	1
eclectic selection	1
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this	0
 but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies  	0
avoid at all costs  	0
i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie  	0
what happened next was prettyoff putting	0
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0
i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone  	0
restaurant is always full but never a wait	1
disapointing results	0
conclusion very filling meals	1
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious	1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored	1
worth every penny	1
 that movie was bad  	0
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it	0
the film lacks any real scares or tension  some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least  i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself  	0
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face	0
i highly recommend this device to everyone	1
even billy bob couldn't rise above the script which was worse  	0

we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left	0
even worse than ticker  	0
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film  	1
what a waste of time	0

you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs	0
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better	0
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad  	0
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1
i was very disappointed in the movie  	0
yes it's shiny on front side  and i love it	1
this place is great	1
it is not good  	0
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing	0

you could drive a semi truck into these holes  	0
they do not care about the consumer one bit	0
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end	1

good prices	1
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical  	0
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound	1
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine	1
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	0
too bad you have to pay up to  a month for the service	0
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic  	1
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me	0
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didn't overwhelm the soup	1

regrettably the film fails  	0
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense  	0
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's  	1
its the best headset i have used	1
delicious and i will absolutely be back	1

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested	1
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here  	0

the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit	1
very pleased with this headset	1
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good	1
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well	0
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
clear skype calls long battery life long range	1
everything about this film is simply incredible  	1
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious	1
food was really boring	0
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor	0
it felt too light and tinny	0
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
this place is like chipotle but better	1
it has all the features i want	1
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film  	1
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late	0
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style  	1
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season  	0
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate	0
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1
poor quality	0
this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon	0
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke	0
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out  	0
my sister has one also and she loves it	1
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset	0
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again	0

my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless	0
reasonably priced also	1

this place is good	1
bad characters bad story and bad acting  	0
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach	0

my friend did not like his bloody mary	0
the real disappointment was our waiter	0
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tv's	1
i like armand assante  my cable company's summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again  	1
restaurant is always full but never a wait	1
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	1
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit	1
while you don't yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928  	1
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant	1
i can assure you that you won't be disappointed	1
the script iswas there a script  	0
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  	0
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear	0
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather	0
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love  	1
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case	1
i promise they won't disappoint	1
its a total package	1
his costars don't fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted  	0

today the graphics are crap  	0
one of the worst shows of all time  	0
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing  	1
it's like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see  	0
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear	1
i won't be back	0
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me  	0
amazon sucks	0
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i	0
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it  	1
it definitely was not as good as my s11	1
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us	0
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award  	1
what did bother me was the slow service	0
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach	0
the burger is good beef cooked just right	1
his performance is simply genius  	1
but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn  	0
if the food isn't bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world's worstannoying drunk people	0
still i do like this movie for it's empowerment of women there's not enough movies out there like this one  	1
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and that's right  	1
always a pleasure dealing with him	1
i've had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho	0
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  	0
it's too bad the food is so damn generic	0
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive	1
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced	0
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well	1
this battery is an excellent bargain	1
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see	1
main thing i didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up	0

hated it  	0
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics	1
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show  	0
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection	1
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely  	0
now this dish was quite flavourful	1
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack	0

5 stars for the brick oven bread app	1

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me	0
went in for happy hour great list of wines	1
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic  a real treat	1
go to place for gyros	1
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible	0
it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time  	1
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie	1
comfortable nice range good battery life	1
we won't be going back	0
even worse than ticker  	0
brilliance indeed  	1
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love  	1
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides	0

i didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me	0
the music in the film is really nice too  	1
i've had better bagels from the grocery store	0
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos	1
wow loved this place	1
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor  	1
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles  	1

great software for motorolas	1
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1
worthwhile	1
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly	1
really good product	1
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it  	1
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were  	0
the plantains were the worst i've ever tasted	0
lightweight and works well	1
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission	1
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons	0

i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas	0
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever	0
this place deserves no stars	0
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing	1
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant	1
i wasn't the least bit interested  	0
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside	1
the shipping time was also very quick	1
i started this review with two stars but i'm editing it to give it only one	0

the character developments also lacked in depth  	0
food was delicious	1
used and dirty	0
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters	1
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost  	1

all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting	1
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  	0

nice design and quality	1
good product good seller	1
nothing special	0
it's very attractive and appears to be of good quality	1
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i won't be back here because it is a convenient location	0

the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	0
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them  	0

it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it	0
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience  	0
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn  	1

everyone is treated equally special	1
it was so cool  	1

one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it  	1
i do not know if this was emilio estevez's directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye  	1

the story line is just awful  	0
this place has it	1

my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away	1
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed	0
this is a beautiful phone	1
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign	0

it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	0
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night  highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 	1
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use	0
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant	0

it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy  	0
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcit's all wrong  	0
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot	1
this movie has a cutting edge to it  	1

one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it  	1
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price	1
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity  	0
it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is	0
great audio	1
don't bother  go to the store	0
the ending is so so perfect you'll shed a tear  	1
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all  	0
perfect for the ps3	1
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased	1
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see  	0
50 down the drain	0
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor  	1
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job	0

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland	0
another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model	0
the results well are a shame  	0

lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables	0
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table	1
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio  so very delightful	1

do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807	0
the manager was the worst	0

either way it sucks  	0
this product is very high quality chinese crap	0
it was way over fried	0
having trouble with volume	0

if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out  	0
very clear quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset	1
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it	0
restored my phone to like new performance	1
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good  	1
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it	1

initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me  	1
not recommended  	0
price is good too	1
do not buy if you want to use the holster	0
conclusion very filling meals	1
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network	0
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us	0
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous  	1
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep  	0
works as described	1
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor	0
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon  	1
my sister has one also and she loves it	1
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently	0
food was delicious	1
none of them are engaging or exciting  	0
if it were possible to give them zero stars they'd have it	0
this is an excellent film  	1
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud	1
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it	1
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed	0

very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist  	0
camera color balance is awful	0
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it  	1

i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great	0
but it is entertaining nonetheless  	1
this is a great phone	1
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets  	1
it's a great place and i highly recommend it	1
good case	1
they do not care about the consumer one bit	0
also difficult to put oni'd recommend avoiding this product	0
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him  	1
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet	1
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star  	1
he's a national treasure  	1
i don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake  	0
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side	0
now this is a movie i really dislike  	0
a good film by a great director  	1
couldn't figure it out	0
saggy floppy piece of junk	0
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen  	1
nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes  	0
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible	0
boy was that sucker dry	0
worse there's an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	0
first time there and might just be the last	0
but it is entertaining nonetheless  	1
i as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible	0
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i won't be back here because it is a convenient location	0
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film  	1
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low	0
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me  	0
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried	1
worked perfectly	1
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast	1
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad  	0
definitely worth checking out  	1
linked to my phone without effort	1
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off	0
i rate this movie 910  	1
i wasn't expecting oscar material but this  	0
i don't know what the big deal is about this place but i won't be back ya'all	0
it even has its sweet moments  	1
this is a good joint	1
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended	1
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict  	0
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  	0
greatno problems at all	1
exceptionally bad  	0
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone	0
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best	1
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end	1
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless	0
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see  	1
 and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away  	0
camera color balance is awful	0
those phones are working just fine now	1
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros	0
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us	0
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good	0
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days	1
terrible service	0
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear	0
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best	1
superb phone on a great network	1
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's upandcoming	1
i can't believe there's even a sequel to this  	0
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	0
the acting sucked  	0
it quit working after i'd used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset i've ever owned	1
definitely not worth the 3 i paid	0
2 times  very bad customer service 	0
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork	0
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack	0
i've missed numerous calls because of this reason	0
i could not recommend these more	0
good value works fine  power via usb car or wall outlet	1
needless to say we will never be back here again	0
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold	1
it is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it	1
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 	1
it isn't even an achievement as a sobadit'sgood or sobadit'smemorable movie  	0
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it	1
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them	1
lots of holes in the script  	0
nothing at all to recommend  	0
i would not recommend this item to anyone	0
battery is holding up well	1
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips	1
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera  	1
while you don't yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928  	1
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original  	0
restored my phone to like new performance	1
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer	0
and the drinks are weak people	0
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price	1
this is an extraordinary film  	1
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing	0
the cast was great  	1
they have great dinners	1
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene  	1
do not buy do not buyit sucks	0
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i won't spoil it  	1
i don't know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories  	1
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one	0
cumbersome design	0
now this dish was quite flavourful	1
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens	0
the cast was great  	1
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas	1
can't upload ringtones from a third party	0
summary the witticisms weren't witty  	0
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well	1
the food was great as always compliments to the chef	1
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre  	1
dont waste your money	0
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda	0
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly  	1
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you	0
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone	0
fast service	1
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two	0
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas	0
and then tragedy struck	0
i would not recommend this place	0
for that it's worth checking out  	1
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional	1
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery	0
works for me	1
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed	1
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use	0
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers  	1
food was really good and i got full petty fast	1
spend your money and time some place else	0
1010  	1
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries	0
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it	0
if you're not familiar check it out	1
has been working great	1
overall i was not impressed and would not go back	0
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here  	1
the chips and sals a here is amazing	1
if you don't find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone	0
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear	0
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only	0
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle	1
the film lacks any real scares or tension  some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least  i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself  	0
now you know why i gave it a 10  	1
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didn't use my common sense	0
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it  	1
not good for the money	0
phenomenal food service and ambiance	1
great brunch spot	1
it is very comfortable on the ear	1
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie  	0
seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on  	0
what a disappointment	0
we thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night	1
generous portions and great taste	1
so far so good	1
disappointed	0
service is quick and friendly	1
this place has it	1
rating 1 out of 10  	0
she carries the movie well  	1
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving  	0
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded  	0
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again  	1
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment  	0
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat	0

it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger	0
horrible had to switch 3 times	0
this is infuriating	0
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant	1
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas	0

it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella the dead  	1
that's rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good	1
brilliance indeed  	1
sauce was tasteless	0
what a disappointment	0
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic	1
what the hell kind of crap is that  	0
the soundtrack sucked  	0
the sides are delish  mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn  beateous	1
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous  	0
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs	0
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what i've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here	1
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious	1
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely  	0
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race  	1
product is exactly as described	1
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up  	1
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue  	1
his performance as awarded was stunning  	1
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better	1
then our food came out disappointment ensued	0
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee	0
cant get the software to work with my computer	0
 but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies  	0
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well	1
i will never forget it now  	1
if you look for authentic thai food go else where	0
excellent wallet type phone case	1
greatno problems at all	1
the concert sequences just sucked  	0
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  	1
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria	1
i would highly recommend this product	1
no complaints	1
poor voice clarity	0
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable  	1
is pretty funny  	1
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing	0
all things considered a job very well done  	1
worst customer service	0
worse there's an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	0
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it  	1
i'm so happy to be here	1
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film  	1
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever	0
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it	0
waitress was sweet and funny	1
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  	1
if you're not familiar check it out	1
they are so cool	1
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great	0
a pretty good product	1
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed  	0
the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite  	0
if it were possible to give them zero stars they'd have it	0
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus  	0
there were too many close ups  	0
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters	1
spend your money and time some place else	0
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak i don't understand	0
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style  	1
good audio quality	1
first time there and might just be the last	0
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section	1
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it  	0
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen  	1
maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible	0
worse there's an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	0
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries	0
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  	1
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart  	1
cool phone	1
this was like the final blow	0
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  	0
an excellent performance from ms  	1
waitress was sweet and funny	1
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script  	1
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this	0
not even good for camp value  	0
the instruction manual is lacking	0
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	0
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular	1
