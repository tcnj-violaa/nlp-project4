too politically correct  	0
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and it's a great color	1
a standout scene  	1
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  	0
being a 90's child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons  	1
very good product well made	1
voice recognition is tremendous	1
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	0

this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff	1

victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable  	0
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy  	0

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i don't want to waste time on bad reviewing i'll leave it at that	0
ample portions and good prices	1

the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant	0

the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is  	0
this place is good	1
internet is excrutiatingly slow	0
anne heche was utterly convincing  	1
nicest chinese restaurant i've been in a while	1

this place is not worth your time let alone vegas	0
 recommend with confidence  	1
i don't have to be an accountant to know i'm getting screwed	0

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing  	1

if you act in such a film you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible  	0
generally it just lacked imagination  	0
it was just too horrible  	0
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	1
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man  	0
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way  	1

john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry  	1
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers	1
this place is amazing	1
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality	1
after 20 minutes wait i got a table	0
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didn't overwhelm the soup	1
pretty good beer selection too	1
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine  	1
it's a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver  	1
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing	1
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0
once your food arrives it's meh	0
items stated as included from the description are not included	0
fantastic earphones	1
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service	1

excellent product	1
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect	0
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcit's all wrong  	0

not impressed	0
con spotty service	0
this place should honestly be blown up	0
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip	1

this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer	1
restored my phone to like new performance	1
battery is terrible	0
another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model	0
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  	1

good food  good service 	1
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs  	0
the service was extremely slow	0
a bit predictable  	0
you wont regret it  	1

this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear	0
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar	0
their research and development division obviously knows what they're doing	1
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman	1
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen	0

he was terrible	0
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit	1
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda	0

third the cheese on my friend's burger was cold	0
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it  	0
cumbersome design	0
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  	0
after charging overnight these batteries work great	1
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is  	1
today the graphics are crap  	0

nice design and quality	1
it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen  	1

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid	1
i loved it it was really scary  	1
all in all i'd expected a better consumer experience from motorola	0
having trouble with volume	0
worthwhile	1
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series  	1
very clear quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset	1
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable	1

total brunch fail	0
very friendly staff	1

his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him  	1
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave  	1
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow	1
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place	0
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known	0
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look	0
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation  	0
the movie seemed a little slow at first  	0
that one didn't work either	0
there's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before	0
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily	0
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home	0
you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie  but you do wish for just a small sample to savor  	1
i was very disappointed	0
i found this product to be waaay too big	0
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist	1
the food wasn't good	0
i don't think you will be disappointed  	1
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
battery is terrible	0
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love  	1
excellent	1
it wasn't busy at all and now we know why	0

the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing	1
don't do it	0

the goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what flavor	1
the igo chargers and tips are really great	1
well im satisfied	1
unfortunately 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain  	0
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all	0
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  	0
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish	1
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace  	0
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's  	1
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 	1
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child  	1
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best	1
i loved the bacon wrapped dates	1
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake	0
sauce was tasteless	0
it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films  	0
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal	1
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything	1
great charger	1
she is as lovely as usual this cutie  	1
but tiny toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created  	1
the camera really likes her in this movie  	1
having trouble with volume	0
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joe's glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene  	0

it's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage  	0

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying	0

the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way	1
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute	1

not tasty and the texture was just nasty	0
cant say enough good things about this place	1
i can't wait to go back	1
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there	0
all in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money  	0
couldn't use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas	0
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect	0
i can't wait to go back	1
plus it's only 8 bucks	1
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything	0
fantastic food	1
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles  	1
this may be the only bad film he ever made  	0

10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  	1

fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips	1
this is a good joint	1
not good by any stretch of the imagination	0

this product is clearly not ready for prime time i don't care how cool it looks if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless	0
i am sorry i made this purchase	0
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	1
buyerbe very careful	0
good prices	1
i don't have to be an accountant to know i'm getting screwed	0

no complaints	1
painful on the ear	0
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star  	1
he really didn't seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests  	0
it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie  	1

very true to shakespear and a 'must' for all shakespear fans  	1
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad	0
also great directing and photography  	1
this is just a great movie  	1
as for the service i'm a fan because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks	1
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations  	1
he deserves 5 stars	1
not tasty and the texture was just nasty	0
lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly won't allow  	0
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing	0
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger	0
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it	1
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see  	0
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable	1

the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten	1

the soundtrack sucked  	0
this place deserves no stars	0
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away	1
service is also cute	1
this is a good battery and it got here really fast	1
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate  	1
it's the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher it's meanings  	1
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage  	1
the service was a little slow  considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace	0
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out  	0

you wont regret it  	1
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago	1
best i've found so far  i've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using	1
well im satisfied	1
great hands free device	1
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste	0
portable and it works	1
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	1
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere	0
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it	0

steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy  	1
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us	0
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally	0
it's pretty easy	1
will not be back	0

the block was amazing	1
i enjoyed it  	1
i'm still infatuated with this phone	1

i sat riveted to the tv screen  	1
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days	1
the camera really likes her in this movie  	1
does everything it should and more	1

good transmit audio	1
good product good seller	1
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas	0
great product	1
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem  	1
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf  	0
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there	1
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner	1
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water	0
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon	0
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase	1
i heart this place	1
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1
i also had to taste my mom's multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious	1
the macarons here are insanely good	1
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us	0
and i just love the colors	1
this is an excellent film  	1
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick  	0
the plot  well i said i'd let that one go  	0
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting  	1
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost  	1
as for the mains also uninspired	0
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	1
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times  	0
long whiny and pointless  	0
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone  	0
nicest chinese restaurant i've been in a while	1

50 down the drain	0
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor	0
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good  	0
the jerky camera movements were also annoying  	0
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there  letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him  	1

tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense  	0
i think not again	0
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review  	0
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted  	0
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid  	0
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect	0

none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly	0
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one	0

better than expected	1
not my thing	0
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase	1
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable  	0
but i definitely would not eat here again	0
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly	0
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time	1
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0
horrible horrible protector	0
terrible service	0
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap	0
it was so cool  	1
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phone's autoanswer	1

please dont waste your money	0
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic	1
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  	1
 the food is rich so order accordingly	1
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service	0
eew this location needs a complete overhaul	0
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant	1
everything is appalling  	0
great hands free device	1
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him  	1
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers	0

in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio  so very delightful	1
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged	0
worth every penny	1
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible	0
it's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch  	1
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying  	0

it's not what it says it is	0
the service was poor and thats being nice	0

both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract  	1

regrettably the film fails  	0
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show  	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever	0
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing  	0
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading	0
it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'  	0
while you don't yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928  	1

great phone	1
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers	1
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped	0
portable and it works	1
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way	0
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh	0

i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history  	1
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food	0
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did	1
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it	1

the delivery was on time	1
 they never brought a salad we asked for	0

im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is  	0
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
these are fabulous	1
great product for the price	1
the ending is so so perfect you'll shed a tear  	1
it's very slow  	0
a standout scene  	1
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2	1
food arrived quickly	1
it does everything the description said it would	1
i don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea	1
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc	1
don't be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010  	1
this movie is also revealing  	1
i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence  	0
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered	0
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone	1
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast  	0
i'm probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it	0
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it	1
i go to far too many places and i've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400	0
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face	0
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best	0
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  	0
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had	1
uncomfortable in the ear don't use with lg vx9900 env	0
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars	0
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor	0
nice leather	1
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful  	0
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is  	1
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  	0
if you haven't gone here go now	1
i've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear	0
setup couldn't have been simpler	1
i won't try going back there even if it's empty	0
the service was outshining  i definitely recommend the halibut	1
the ambiance isn't much better	0
best headset ever	1
very good stuff for the price	1
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything  	1
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1
it does everything the description said it would	1
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good	1
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible	0
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect	0
that one didn't work either	0
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see	1
would not recommend to others	0
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic	1
omit watching this  	0
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything	1
it felt too light and tinny	0
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding  	0
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow	1
the staff was very attentive	1
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear	0
i own 2 of these cases and would order another	1
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle	1
what the hell kind of crap is that  	0
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy  	0
weird vibe from owners	0
you won't regret it	1
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams  	1
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release  	0
the bt headset was such a disapoinment	0
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too  	0
the script is a big flawed mess  	0
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film  	1
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better	0
the case is great and works fine with the 680	1
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts  	1
food was really good and i got full petty fast	1
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight	1
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is  	1
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist  	0
it is an insane game  	1
the service was not up to par either	0
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tv's	1
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review	0
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price	1
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint	0
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode  	0
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip	0
all in all i'm quite satisfied with this purchase	1
she carries the movie well  	1
glad i didn't pay to see it  	0
great pizza and salads	1
good product good seller	1
that just screams legit in my booksomethat's also pretty rare here in vegas	1

star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series  	0
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered	1
my phone sounded ok  not great  ok but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldn't understand a word being said on it	0
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe  poor hummh  	0
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before	1
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset	0
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles	1
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying	0
do not buy do not buyit sucks	0
the dialogue is atrocious  	0
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine	1
not too screamy not to masculine but just right  	1
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent	1
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all	0
there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit  	0
the battery life is highly unacceptable	0
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
works great	1
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear	0
then our food came out disappointment ensued	0
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion  	1
i love their fries and their beans	1
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast  	1
new battery works great in phone	1
if you want a real scare rent this one  	1
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm	0
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious	1
the worst was the salmon sashimi	0
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen  	1
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
nice design and quality	1
i probably would not go here again	0
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there	1
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it  	1
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated	1
fantastic food	1
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it	1
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission	1
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good	1
very easy to use	1
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset	0
gets the job done	1
lame would be the best way to describe it  	0
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job  	1
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature	1
i wasn't the least bit interested  	0
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
 don't waste your time  	0
i would not recommend this place	0
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i	0
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you	0
it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen  	1
give it a try you will be happy you did	1
an excellent performance from ms  	1
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did	0
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try  	1
i was seated immediately	1
im in az all the time and now have my new spot	1
overall i don't think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too	0
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features  	1
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem	0
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor	0
battery life is real good	1
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i won't spoil it  	1
soggy and not good	0
mediocre food	0
great sound and service	1
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	1
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in	0
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics	1
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk	0
love this product	1
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  	1

i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone	1
this place deserves no stars	0
i love this phone	1
was not happy	0
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great	1
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action  	0
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable  	0
very friendly staff	1
the service was extremely slow	0
the block was amazing	1
this place has it	1
wow what a bad film  	0
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended	1
i also had to taste my mom's multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious	1
the worst was the salmon sashimi	0
the patio seating was very comfortable	1
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it  	1
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear	1
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive	1
which are small and not worth the price	0
still i do like this movie for it's empowerment of women there's not enough movies out there like this one  	1
is pretty funny  	1
overall i like there food and the service	1
beautiful styling though	1
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing  	0
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked	1
battery has no life	0
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing	0
awesome service and food	1
extremely tasty	1
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery	1
and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you  the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors  	0
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing	0
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery	1
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off  	0
those burgers were amazing	1
service was good and the company was better	1
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything i've tried gets my seal of approval	1
i can't wait to go back	1
food was below average	0
each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious	1
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer	0
i was not happy with this item	0
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible	0
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron	0
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good  	1
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue  	0
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant	1
it's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound  	1
i can't use this case because the smell is disgusting	0
i took back my money and got outta there	0
i don't think i'll be running back to carly's anytime soon for food	0

none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly	0
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc  	0

this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
for service i give them no stars	0

it's aggravating	0
good show samsung	1
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works  	1
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  	0
the manager was the worst	0
great food	1
it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie  	1

and those baby owls were adorable  	1
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans  	1
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up	0
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldn't have even been created  	0
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago  	1
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste	1

the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun	1
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0
i enjoyed it  	1
things that went wrong  they burned the saganaki	0
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens	0
good value works fine  power via usb car or wall outlet	1
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film  it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation  	0
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures  	0
you can't beat that	1
cumbersome design	0
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best	1
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors i'd rather be using a disposable then this	0
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale  	1
the ending is so so perfect you'll shed a tear  	1
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films  	1
good case excellent value	1
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it	0
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish	1
ample portions and good prices	1
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating	0
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful  	0
don't bother  go to the store	0
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way	0
don't bother  go to the store	0
worthless product	0
clear skype calls long battery life long range	1
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer	0
i just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine	0
the jerky camera movements were also annoying  	0
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before  	1
i came out of it feeling angry  	0
plan on ordering from them again and again	1
this item is fantastic and works perfectly	1
it was absolutely amazing	1
it deserves strong love  	1
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended	1
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
long whiny and pointless  	0
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one	0
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude	1
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole  	1
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict  	0
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy  	0
if you look for authentic thai food go else where	0
it looks very nice	1
that was nice  	1
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting	1
i usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight  doesn't mess up my hair	1
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected	0
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa  is that the new phone on tv	1
very disappointed	0
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  	0
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that	0
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends	1
i believe that pitch black was done well  	1
now this dish was quite flavourful	1
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature	1
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor	0
really awful  	0
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget  	1
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while	1
never had anything to complain about here	1
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious	1
in short don't bother with this movie  	0
it was so funny  	1
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far	1
essentially you can forget microsoft's tech support	0
awesome device	1

yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture  	1
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series  	0
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  	1

not recommended  	0
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor	0
after my phone got to be about a year old it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part	0
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it	0
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well	1
the movie showed a lot of florida at it's best made it look very appealing  	1
total waste of time	0
the buttons for on and off are bad	0
we won't be going back	0
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor	0
it also had a new problem	0
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short	0

i would not recommend this place	0
cute quaint simple honest	1
omelets are to die for	1
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible	0
also makes it easier to hold on to	1
you can find better movies at youtube  	0
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me	0
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  	1
also difficult to put oni'd recommend avoiding this product	0
what did bother me was the slow service	0
not good enough for the price	0
food was delicious	1
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all	1
very comfortable	1
that just screams legit in my booksomethat's also pretty rare here in vegas	1
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time  	1
bad characters bad story and bad acting  	0
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them	0
nice design and quality	1
you cant go wrong with any of the food here	1
i had a seriously solid breakfast here	1
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever	0
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake	0
i really liked that  	1
that's rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good	1
food quality has been horrible	0
it was absolutely amazing	1
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed	1
i've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it	1
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  	0
now i know that i made a wise decision	1
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  	0
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  	0
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad  	0
but i definitely would not eat here again	0
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed  	1
happy so far	1
you get what you pay for i guess	0
it has everything i need and i couldn't ask for more	1
good product good seller	1
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point	0
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it	1
i am more than happy with this product	1
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget  	1
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone	0
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat	1
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews	1
they work about 2 weeks then break	0
this place is two thumbs upway up	1
it was not good	0
nice docking station for home or work	1
it really created a unique feeling though  	1
product is exactly as described	1
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad  	0
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great	1
 comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously	1
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like they're 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc  	0
after one bite i was hooked	1
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish	0
but tiny toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created  	1
1 it works  2 it is comfortable	1
the story is also both funny and poignant at times  	1
i especially love the long battery life	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking  	0
we won't be returning	0
you'll love it  	1
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better	0
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees	0
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it	1
i was mortified	0
this is a great deal	1
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show  	0
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head  	1
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place	1
very much disappointed with this company	0
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza	1
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year	1
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable  	1
this place is great	1
i'd advise anyone to go and see it  	1
i will never forget it now  	1
audio quality is poor very poor	0
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood	1
the worst experience ever	0
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful  	0
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
def coming back to bowl next time	1
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked  	0
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family	1
i started this review with two stars but i'm editing it to give it only one	0
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south  	1
very clear quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset	1
disappointed	0
these are the nicest restaurant owners i've ever come across	1
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
their research and development division obviously knows what they're doing	1
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor	0
i do think tom hanks is a good actor  	1
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film  	1
also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design  costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar  	1
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn't receive and place calls	0
can't store anything but phone numbers to sim	0
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch  	1
it felt too light and tinny	0
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception	1
do not waste your time  	0
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside  	0
it will drive you barking mad  	0
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella the dead  	1
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating  	1
we enjoy their pizza and brunch	1
this is a great little item	1
excellent product for the price	1
i got food poisoning here at the buffet	0
all in all i'd expected a better consumer experience from motorola	0
i'll definitely be in soon again	1
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe  poor hummh  	0
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie  	0
this battery is an excellent bargain	1
avoid this establishment	0
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great	1
started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters  	0
it's really easy	1
pretty piece of junk	0
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing	1
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience	1
a standout scene  	1
nothing at all to recommend  	0
you won't forget this movie  	1
disappointed	0
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated	0
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them	0
nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes  	0
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair	0
summary the witticisms weren't witty  	0
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking	0
everything stinks  	0

lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly won't allow  	0
really pleased with this product so far	1
i'm happy about this purchase good quality and low price	1
attempting artiness with black  white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed  became even more ridiculous  as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent  	0

 the food is rich so order accordingly	1
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio  so very delightful	1
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount	1
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop  	1
excellent wallet type phone case	1
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far	1
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame  	1
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry	0
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible	0
it quit working after i'd used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset i've ever owned	1
another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model	0

there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible  	0

now this is a movie i really dislike  	0
do not purchase this phone	0
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie	1

this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldn't have even been created  	0
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see	0
used and dirty	0
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity  	0
i hope this place sticks around	1
the instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used	0
i'll definitely be in soon again	1
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water	0

but it is entertaining nonetheless  	1

julian fellowes has triumphed again  	1
our server was super nice and checked on us many times	1
for service i give them no stars	0
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset	0
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere	0
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted	1
good transmit audio	1
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before	1
i want my money back	0
my 810 score is mostly for the plot  	1
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen  	1

the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked	0
reception is terrible and full of static	0
all in all i think it was a good investment	1
i am glad i purchased it	1
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons  	0
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product	1
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined	0
the macarons here are insanely good	1
this one just fails to create any real suspense  	0
this place is great	1
nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes  	0
honeslty it didn't taste that fresh	0
i could barely stomach the meal but didn't complain because it was a business lunch	0
the suspense builders were good  just cross the line from g to pg  	1
and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you  the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors  	0
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone  	0
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic  	0
you could drive a semi truck into these holes  	0
i promise they won't disappoint	1
funny clever hip  just like pray's previous film hype  	1
nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes  	0

don't miss it  	1
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order	0
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible	0
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative  	0
the staff was very attentive	1
it kept getting worse and worse so now i'm officially done	0
after charging overnight these batteries work great	1
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 	1
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio  so very delightful	1
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone	0
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake  	0
it's like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet	0
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off	1
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day	0
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing	0
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced	0
the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it  	0
great product fast shipping	1
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  	1
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one  	1
will order from them again	1
but tiny toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created  	1
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture  	1
i could care less the interior is just beautiful	1
i will never forget it now  	1
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options	1
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic  a real treat	1
if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice  	1

the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer	0

great subway in fact it's so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations	1
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland	0
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate  	1
the veggitarian platter is out of this world	1
mic doesn't work	0
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers  	1
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad	0

the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well  	1
i hate movies like that  	0
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful	1
 anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot  	1
sooooo good	1
in short  this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film  	0
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	0
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good	0
i will not be eating there again	0
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism  	1
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep  	0
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i don't want to waste time on bad reviewing i'll leave it at that	0
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget	1
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase	1
love this product	1
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well  	1
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there	1
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic  	0
it kept getting worse and worse so now i'm officially done	0
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre  	1
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters	1
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap  	0

the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal	1
if you simply want a small flip phone  look elsewhere as the extra bells  whistles are mediocre	0
i don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store it's not even a real movie  	0
we are sending it back	0
too politically correct  	0
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear	0
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer	0
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	0
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed	0

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent  	1
it has been a winner for us	1
no plot whatsoever  	0
piece of junk	0
timely shipment and quality product	1
great price too	1
graphics is far from the best part of the game  	0

the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone	0
the visual effects were awful  	0
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking  	0
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i don't care how cool it looks if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless	0
prosgood camera  very nice pictures  also has cool styles like black and white and more	1
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo	1
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead  	1
maybe it's just their vegetarian fare but i've been twice and i thought it was average at best	0
i mean this in a terrible way  	0
great phone	1
he was terrible	0
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious	1
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america  	0
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars	0

these headphones were a great find  and i think they are perhaps the best purchase i've made in the last several years  seriously	1
what a disappointment	0

great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts	1
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago	1

but i definitely would not eat here again	0
works great	1
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing	1
no ear loop needed it's tiny and the sound is great	1
cool phone	1
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot  	0
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film  	1
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh	0
 anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot  	1
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas	0
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i won't be going back	0

it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen  	1
my headset works just peachykeen	1

even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad  	0
i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence  	0
the menu is always changing food quality is going down  service is extremely slow	0
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years  	1
1010  	1
awesome device	1
this is the first phone i've had that has been so cheaply made	0
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious	1
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign	0
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again	1
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas	0
it definitely was not as good as my s11	1
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food	0
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun	1
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before	1
horrible horrible protector	0
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb  complex  	1
delicious and i will absolutely be back	1
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience  	1
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1
she is as lovely as usual this cutie  	1
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc  	0
yes it's shiny on front side  and i love it	1
i have read other's reviews here but i haven't had any problem with it	1
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen	0
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters  	0
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had	1
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs  	1
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign	0
better than you'd expect	1
i also didn't like the on button it felt like it would crack with use	0
they have great dinners	1
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didn't expect more tip than that	1
you can't beat the price on these	1
big disappointment with calendar sync	0
i don't have to be an accountant to know i'm getting screwed	0
i love this bluetooth	1
very nice and relaxing late night viewing  	1
now this is a movie i really dislike  	0
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  	0
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone	0
this movie is bad  	0
you cant go wrong with any of the food here	1
the plug did not work very well	0
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked	0
there is a brilliant twist ending  	1
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine  	1
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty  	0
very disappointed	0
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side	0
and those baby owls were adorable  	1
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me	1
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it  	1
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well	1
just don't know why they were so slow	0
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen  	0
i started this review with two stars but i'm editing it to give it only one	0
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and that's right  	1
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget  	1
the service was terrible food was mediocre	0
the commercials are the most misleading	0
this is a great deal	1
the music in the film is really nice too  	1
avoid at all costs  	0
looks great and is strong	1
it isn't even an achievement as a sobadit'sgood or sobadit'smemorable movie  	0
i'd say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of m's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing	1

damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen  	1
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best	0
my girlfriend's veal was very bad	0
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was  how it contained holes inconsistencies and  frankly  a whole lot of crap  and how horrid the dancing was  	0

now this is a movie i really dislike  	0
the block was amazing	1
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us	0
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting  	0

this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it  	1
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely  	0
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked	0
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested	1
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service	0
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world	1
we'll never go again	0

when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way	0
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20  left in the morning	0
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more  	0
