the waitresses are very friendly	1
we waited for forty five minutes in vain	0
service is friendly and inviting	1

perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera  	1
my colleague  i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great	1
wow loved this place	1
if the food isn't bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world's worstannoying drunk people	0
either way it sucks  	0
 down the drain because of a weak snap	0
i don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt	0
but this movie really got to me  	1
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill  	1
worse there's an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	0
great case and price	1
reasonably priced also	1
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors  	0
very good quality though	1
it's fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable	1
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it	0
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1

i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone	0
disappointed	0
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul	1
all things considered a job very well done  	1
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service	1
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again  	1
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives	0
the dialogue sucked  	0
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off	0
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm	0
i wasn't the least bit interested  	0
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  	0
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love	1
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh	1
it is shameful  	0
the directing seems too pretentious  	0
it was so boring  	0
buy a different phone  but not this	0
the desserts were a bit strange	0
what a disappointment	0
it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason  	0
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door	0
his performance as awarded was stunning  	1
food was great and so was the serivce	1
needless to say i wasted my money	0
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery	0
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant	0
just spicy enough perfect actually	1
overall i like there food and the service	1
don't do it	0
it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is	0
this is a great deal	1
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho	1
the service here leaves a lot to be desired	0
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  	1
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real  	1
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid  	0
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it	1
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either	0
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back	1
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it  	1
wow very spicy but delicious	1
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was  	1
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try  	1
it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason  	0
i had a seriously solid breakfast here	1
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process  	1
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked	0
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts	1
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  	0
i love this bluetooth	1
it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time  	1
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone	0
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and i'm glad i did	1
must have been an off night at this place	0
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility  	1
after my phone got to be about a year old it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part	0
i advise you to look out for it  	1
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	1
i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence  	0
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
it was so cool  	1
the presentation of the food was awful	0
i will not be eating there again	0
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it	1
i'd love to go back	1
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear	0
i didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me	0
you cant go wrong with any of the food here	1
overall i don't think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too	0
plus with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job  	1
the selection was probably the worst i've seen in vegasthere was none	0
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast	1
customer service was terrible	0
this is infuriating	0
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	0
camera color balance is awful	0
on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  	0
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise	0
i don't know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories  	1
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor	0
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up	1
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant	0
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other  	1
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way	0
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy  	0
woa talk about awful  	0
i didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious	1
it was so funny  	1
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
there was nothing believable about it at all  	0
anne heche was utterly convincing  	1
the bartender was also nice	1
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits	0
restaurant is always full but never a wait	1
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite	1
excellent	1
all in all i think it was a good investment	1
great pizza and salads	1
after 20 minutes wait i got a table	0
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again	0
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	0
i love their fries and their beans	1
last time buying from you	0
the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce  	0
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow	1
three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen  	1
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever	0
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair	0
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar	0
everything about this movie is stupid  	0
what a big waste of time	0
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking	0
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good  	1
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic  	0
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this  	1
i won't be back	0
this is actually a very smart movie  	1
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables	0
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show  	0
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid  	0
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things	0
also the story and acting were weak  	0
as for the service i'm a fan because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks	1
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film  	1
i went to bachi burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed	1

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order  all yummy for my tummy	1
2 times  very bad customer service 	0
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i won't spoil it  	1
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish	1
the film's dialogue is natural real to life  	1
glad i didn't pay to see it  	0
new battery works great in phone	1
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked	0

food was delicious	1
i'm so happy to be here	1
it will drive you barking mad  	0
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal	1
it's fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable	1
their daily specials are always a hit with my group	1
but it is entertaining nonetheless  	1
the han nan chicken was also very tasty	1
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care	1
 in fact it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself  	1
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out  	0
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens	0
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south  	1
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism  	1
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design	0
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos	1
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant	1
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying	0
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job  	1
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night  highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 	1
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere  	0
this is a good battery and it got here really fast	1
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period  	0
i've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it	1
very friendly staff	1
only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far	1
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means	0
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up  	0
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal	1
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	0
it's like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
probably not in a hurry to go back	0
and quite honestly often its not very good  	0
did not like at all	0
i want my money back	0
the phone was unusable and was not new	0
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything i've tried gets my seal of approval	1
we are so glad we found this place	1
camerawork  again bad  	0
hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood  	1
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars	0
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem	0
i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk  	0
definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness  	1
excellently produced by one of scifi's best producers scot vandiver   	1
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best	0
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
and there wasn't a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here  	1
now you know why i gave it a 10  	1
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value	1
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well  	1
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price	1
looks great and is strong	1
could not get strong enough signal	0
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid  	0
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service	1
it'll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix	1
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service	0
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving	1
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time i'm in vegas	1
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style  	1
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack	0
it didn't work people can not hear me when i talk	0
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed	0
clear skype calls long battery life long range	1
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended	1
2 thumbs up	1
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables	0
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known	0
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear	1
the staff was very attentive	1
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table	0
the service was a little slow  considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace	0
i'm not eating here	0
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me	0
i would not recommend this item to anyone	0
cute quaint simple honest	1
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasn't great	0
the management is rude	0
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star  	1
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up	0
it wasn't busy at all and now we know why	0
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use	0
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phone's autoanswer	1
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0
the service was terrible food was mediocre	0
a standout scene  	1
no complaints	1
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i won't spoil it  	1
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives  	1
if someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart	0
awful  	0
it works	1
this is not moviemaking  	0
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier	1
friend's pasta  also bad he barely touched it	0
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well	1
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad  	0
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience	1
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this  	1
overall i was not impressed and would not go back	0

so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon	1
trumbull on i love lucy  	1
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer	1

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart  	1
great charger	1
essentially you can forget microsoft's tech support	0
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho	0
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad  	0
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it  	1
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature	1
poorly contstruct hinge	0
hated it  	0
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen  	1
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre  	1
i highly recommend this case	1
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic  	0
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off	0
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tv's	1
she's poised and amazing  	1
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one	0
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice	0
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying	0
overall i don't think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too	0
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	1
overall i was not impressed and would not go back	0
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone	0
this if the first movie i've given a 10 to in years  	1
i'll give this film 10 out of 10  	1
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic  	0
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr	0
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep  	0
after one bite i was hooked	1
would not reccommend	0
i would recommend this	1
the cast is good  	1
works great	1
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts  	0
the film's dialogue is natural real to life  	1
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving  	0
no real improvement	0
dont waste your money	0
great phone	1
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see  	0
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	1
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i don't care how cool it looks if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless	0
i cannot make calls at certain places	0
friend's pasta  also bad he barely touched it	0
never had anything to complain about here	1

great product	1
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia	1
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star  	1
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn  	1
the waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us	0
the inside is really quite nice and very clean	1
prosgood camera  very nice pictures  also has cool styles like black and white and more	1

but it is great i would really recommend it	1
i would recommend this	1
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door	0
but tiny toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created  	1
the menu is always changing food quality is going down  service is extremely slow	0
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head  	1
10 out of 10 stars  	1
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i	1
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it	1
we've tried to like this place but after 10 times i think we're done with them	0
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	0
as many people complained i found this headset's microphone was very weak	0
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush it's amazing what they do with eggplant	1
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it	1
i couldn't think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy  	1
we've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant	0
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down	0
terrible product and waste of money	0
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh	1
10 out of 10 stars  	1
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant	1
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miner's daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire  	1
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call	0
i won't be back	0
if someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart	0
great product	1
dont waste your money	0
awful service	0
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman	1
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this  	0
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it	0
the staff are also very friendly and efficient	1
the battery is completely useless to me	0
i'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place	0
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes	0
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art  	1
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone	0
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume	0
pretty cool i would say	1
friend's pasta  also bad he barely touched it	0
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case	1
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great	1
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear	0
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers  	1
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldn't produce my receipt i was out of luck	0
maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible	0
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount	1
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art  	1
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar	1
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it	0
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables	0
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored	1
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was  	1
great subway in fact it's so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations	1
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended	1
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
come hungry leave happy and stuffed	1
the story is also both funny and poignant at times  	1
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning	1
i sat riveted to the tv screen  	1
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn't receive and place calls	0
the service here leaves a lot to be desired	0
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful	0
total waste of time	0
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesn't know how to pace his films  	0
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service	0

things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  	0
awful service	0

i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch	0
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle	1

overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking  	1
it has everything i need and i couldn't ask for more	1
i literally vomited while watching this film  	0
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable  	0
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better	1
both do good jobs and are quite amusing  	1
i love this phone	1
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine	1
bad fit way too big	0
the poor actors  	0
great headset very impressed  h500	1
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked	0
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
well im satisfied	1
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it	0
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film  	1
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed	0
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was  	1

the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going  	1

these were so good we ordered them twice	1
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way	0
we'd definitely go back here again	1
never going back	0
plan on ordering from them again and again	1
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella the dead  	1
i think not again	0
overpriced for what you are getting	0
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  	0
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly	0
this phone might well be the worst i've ever had in any brand	0
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good	1
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone	0
horrible  	0
doesn't last long	0
i usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight  doesn't mess up my hair	1
i'm trying to return it for a refund	0
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous	1

it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen  	0
the battery works great	1

waste of 13 bucks	0
light weight i hardly notice it is there	1

the jerky camera movements were also annoying  	0
this is a good battery and it got here really fast	1
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love	1
anne heche was utterly convincing  	1
like the other reviewer said you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again	0
i'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere	0
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating  	1
i can assure you that you won't be disappointed	1
it was just too horrible  	0
woa talk about awful  	0
i was not happy with this item	0
i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style sensitivities and treatments  	1

this place has it	1
it has been a winner for us	1
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day	0
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last	0
and the drinks are weak people	0
i had strawberry tea which was good	1
i'd say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of m's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing	1
restaurant is always full but never a wait	1
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use	0
works good	1
i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn  	1
too bad cause i know it's family owned i really wanted to like this place	0
the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce  	0
battery life is also great	1
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes  	0
then our food came out disappointment ensued	0
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor	0
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this	0
must have been an off night at this place	0
thanks good a movie like this was done and released  	1
disappointed	0
i've had better bagels from the grocery store	0
i never come again	0
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed	0
i'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place	0
generally it just lacked imagination  	0
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset	0
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing	0
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was  	1
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that	1
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool	1
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle	1
yet i enjoy watching it  	1
when i'm on this side of town this will definitely be a spot i'll hit up again	1
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed	1
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem	0
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown	0
all in all i'd expected a better consumer experience from motorola	0
my 810 score is mostly for the plot  	1
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate	0
i hate writing bad reviews about films  especially those in which i really like the star  but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it  	0
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	1

i am glad i purchased it	1
see both films if you can  	1

every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through  	0
the soundtrack sucked  	0
after my phone got to be about a year old it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part	0

all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting	1
and the sound quality is great	1
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up	1
eclectic selection	1
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them	0
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated	1

i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and i'm very happy with my purchase	1
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing  	0
it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'  	0
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style  	1
i can't believe there's even a sequel to this  	0
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc	0

if you simply want a small flip phone  look elsewhere as the extra bells  whistles are mediocre	0
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means	0
waste your money on this game  	1

10 out of 10 stars  	1

this place was such a nice surprise	1
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen  	0
wow loved this place	1
the kids play area is nasty	0
could not get strong enough signal	0
what did bother me was the slow service	0
omelets are to die for	1
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them	0
waitress was good though	1
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura  	1
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles  	1
great earpiece	1
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them  	0

i was very disappointed	0
i love this bluetooth	1
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere  	0
but tiny toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created  	1
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc	1
we thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night	1
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case	1
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset	0
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off	0
what i really like there is the crepe station	1
that company is a joke	0
soyo technology sucks	0

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place	1
best i've found so far  i've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using	1
regardless the film fails on most levels  	0

i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it  	1
i wasted my little money with this earpiece	0
only pros  large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough	1
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature	1
nice case feels good in your hands	1
not good enough for the price	0
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life  	0
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great	1
i'm still infatuated with this phone	1
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film  	1
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed	0
we won't be returning	0

leopard print is wonderfully wild	1
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days	0
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle	1
great earpiece	1
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	1
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late	0
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food	0
also the story and acting were weak  	0
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch  	1
but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn  	0
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  	0
i only hear garbage for audio	0
i did not expect this to be so good	1
very true to shakespear and a 'must' for all shakespear fans  	1
the bt headset was such a disapoinment	0
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look	0
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late	0
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well	1

this scene is very strong and unpleasant  	0
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions	1
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network	0

i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style sensitivities and treatments  	1
the service was terrible though	0

i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger	0
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one	1
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us	0
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7	1
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff	1
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then i'm lost	0
waitress was good though	1
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous	1
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up	0
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while	1
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad  	0
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed	0
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish	1
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means	0
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character  	1
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold	1
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  	0
poor quality	0
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical  	0
thoroughly disappointed	0
this place is two thumbs upway up	1
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0

do not make the same mistake as me	0
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen	0

the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop  	1
you could drive a semi truck into these holes  	0
but even the talented carrell can't save this  	0
it also had a new problem	0
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again	1
then the film just dropped the ball  	0
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry  	1
it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is	0
i don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt	0
you can find better movies at youtube  	0
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me	0
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  	0
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today  	1
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem	1
i usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight  doesn't mess up my hair	1
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant	1
hitchcock is a great director  	1

however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible	0
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
it is zillion times away from reality  	0

if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one	0
but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn  	0
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good	1
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public  	0
lightweight and works well	1
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food	0

this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something	1
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives  	1
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going  	1
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs  	1
the plot  well i said i'd let that one go  	0
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr  	1
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is  	0
does everything it should and more	1
what a waste of money and time	0
you'll love it  	1
the commercials are the most misleading	0
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place	1
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use	1
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i	1
you'll love it  	1
the service was a little slow  considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace	0
the battery is completely useless to me	0
and none of the tones is acceptable	0

but this movie is definitely a below average rent  	0
a fly was in my apple juice a fly	0

the service was poor and thats being nice	0
i never come again	0
very friendly staff	1
good audio quality	1
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good	1
it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time  	1
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn  	1
hitchcock is a great director  	1
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible	0
lightweight and works well	1
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated	1

it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'  	0
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back	1
thoroughly disappointed	0
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen  	1
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  	0
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested	1

 and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away  	0
and it was way to expensive	0
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me	0
it's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg	0
you could drive a semi truck into these holes  	0
i advise you to look out for it  	1
i never walked out of a movie faster  	0
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad  	0
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating  	1
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look	0

this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  	0
the dialogue is atrocious  	0
everything was perfect the night we were in	1
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked	0
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic	1
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point	0
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other  	1
the service was outshining  i definitely recommend the halibut	1

someone shouldve invented this sooner	1
woa talk about awful  	0

i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only	0
it's been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation	1
i usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight  doesn't mess up my hair	1

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order  all yummy for my tummy	1
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white lowbudget original  	1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored	1
i'm glad this pretentious piece of s didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of québec  	0
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time  	0
the phone was unusable and was not new	0
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying	0
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza	1
bad characters bad story and bad acting  	0
that company is a joke	0
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus  	0
that was funny  	1
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack	0
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture  	1
also the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player	0
it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work  	1
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing	1
gets a signal when other verizon phones won't	1
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best	1
avoid at all costs  	0

unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening	0
so bad  	0
i received it quickly and it works great	1
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars	0
what a big waste of time	0
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  	0
how stupid is that	0
avoid at any and all costs  	0
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  	0
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration	0
please dont waste your money	0
the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it  	0
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while	0
very very fun chef	1
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame  	1
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
after two i felt disgusting	0
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser	1
piece of junk	0
don't be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010  	1
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection	1
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater	0
this is a stunning movie  	1
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing  	0
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander  	1
not too screamy not to masculine but just right  	1
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale  	1
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think we'll just go to ninja sushi next time	0
this film has no redeeming features  	0
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing	1
i'm still infatuated with this phone	1
audio quality is poor very poor	0
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you	0
comfort for our whole family	1
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound	1
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility  	1
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine  	1
really ugly	0
very clear quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset	1
so just beware	0
another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after  	0
a good film by a great director  	1
this show is made for americans  it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere  	0
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous  	1
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor  	1
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas	1
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  	0
too bad cause i know it's family owned i really wanted to like this place	0
this scene is very strong and unpleasant  	0
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home	0
this place lacked style	0
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing	1
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before  	0
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great	1
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated	1
went in for happy hour great list of wines	1
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing	0
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late	0
our server was super nice and checked on us many times	1
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style  	1
this movie is bad  	0
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean	1
it wasn't busy at all and now we know why	0
bad fit way too big	0
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film  it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation  	0
this place is horrible and way overpriced	0
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days	0
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed  	1
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child  	1
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation  	0
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
the food was terrible	0
i don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea	1
hitchcock is a great director  	1
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  	1
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief  	0
i love this place	1
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem	1
