a film not easily forgotten  	1
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20  left in the morning	0
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold	0
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway	0
but this movie really got to me  	1
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
very bad experience	0
works great	1
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing  	0
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it	0
the aerial scenes were welldone  	1
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	0
actually the graphics were good at the time  	1
as for the service i thought it was good	1
i'm very disappointed with my decision	0
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time	1
great phone	1
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it	0
it's close to my house it's lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food	1
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film  	1
great subway in fact it's so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations	1
the food was very good	1
we'd definitely go back here again	1
it's a piece of crap	0
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything  	1
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however it's not	1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored	1
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again	0
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it  	0
as for the service i thought it was good	1
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it	1
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design	0
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene  	0
service is also cute	1
will not be back	0
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i won't spoil it  	1
strike 2 who wants to be rushed	0
worst customer service ever	0
1010  	1
the only downside is the service	0
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	0
in short don't bother with this movie  	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever	0
it definitely was not as good as my s11	1
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop	0
another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after  	0
i sat riveted to the tv screen  	1
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever  	1
i don't know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories  	1
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers	1
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car	1
it's just lame  	0
piece of trash	0
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film  	1
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality	1
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty  	0
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful  	0
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it	1
great pizza and salads	1
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me	0
it's a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver  	1
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone	1
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema  	1
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means	0
its not user friendly	0
i won't be back	0
warning  do not buy	0
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more  	0
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  	0
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it	1
not good enough for the price	0
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far	1
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well	1
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions	1
best breakfast buffet	1
talk about great customer service of course we will be back	1
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again	1
better than new	1
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i'm not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer  	0
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good	0
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience  	1
they know how to make them here	1
it deserves strong love  	1
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch  	1
new battery works great in phone	1
this is a good battery and it got here really fast	1
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see	0
after 20 minutes wait i got a table	0
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous	1
the only downside is the service	0
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced	0
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch  	1
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle	1
and it was way to expensive	0
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it	1
the pleather case doesn't fit	0
it's pure brilliance  	1
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed	0
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were  	0
camera color balance is awful	0
it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie  	1
i thought it was bad  	0
another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model	0
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars	0
very disappointed	0
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years  	1
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i don't expect any problems	1
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  	1
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place	1
so far so good	1
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit	1
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone	0
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season  	0
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes	0
this one is simply a disappointment	0
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it	0
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors  	0
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this  bad idea we both hated it  	0
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting	1
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie  	0
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter	1
very very fun chef	1
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds	0
as for the mains also uninspired	0
love the margaritas too	1
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago	1
fast service	1
worked great	1
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one	1
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing  	1
great phone	1
the budget was evidently very limited  	0
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had	1
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it	1
love the margaritas too	1
great product	1
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty  	0
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order  all yummy for my tummy	1
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive	1
great hands free device	1
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  	1
i consider this theft	0
one of my favorite purchases ever	1
i was very impressed with the price of the cases	1
i can assure you that you won't be disappointed	1
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever	0
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor	0
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated	0
while you don't yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928  	1
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  	0
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense  	0
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great	0
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food	0
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well	1
extremely tasty	1
lots of holes in the script  	0
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame  	1
perfect for the ps3	1
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed	1
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in	0
nice docking station for home or work	1
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  	1
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made  	1
and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you  the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors  	0
i'm not really sure how joey's was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine	0
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone  	0
customer service was terrible	0
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter	1
i don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake  	0
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it  	1
i usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight  doesn't mess up my hair	1
the aerial scenes were welldone  	1
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything  	1
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown	0
everything was fresh and delicious	1
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed	0
the bartender was also nice	1
excellent	1
i thought it was bad  	0
extremely tasty	1
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on  	0
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading	0
food was great and so was the serivce	1
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh	0
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous	0
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear	0
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  	0
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset	0
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere	0
lots of holes in the script  	0
great value	1
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff	1
ryan's bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i won't be revisiting	0

the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic	1
hitchcock is a great director  	1
great food	1
it quit working after i'd used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset i've ever owned	1
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i won't be back here because it is a convenient location	0
needless to say we will never be back here again	0
excellent cast story line performances  	1
the music in the film is really nice too  	1
the poor actors  	0

give it a try you will be happy you did	1
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	0
last time buying from you	0
there were too many close ups  	0
i wasted my little money with this earpiece	0

much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas	1
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service	1
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work	0
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night  highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 	1
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper	1
he was terrible	0
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet	0
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost  	1
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well  	1
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective  	1
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone	1
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series  	0
mishima is extremely uninteresting  	0
that's a huge design flaw unless i'm not using it correctly which i don't think is the case	0
nothing special	0
first of all it doesn't wear well	0
it is an insane game  	1
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud	1
couldn't figure it out	0
definitely worth checking out  	1
great movie  	1
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere  	0
 and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away  	0
the desserts were a bit strange	0
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  	1
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12	0
all in all i can assure you i'll be back	1
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  	1
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others  	1
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  	0
pretty awesome place	1
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot  	0
do not make the same mistake as me	0
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were	0
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does	0

i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality	1
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special	1
this short film certainly pulls no punches  	0
the service was extremely slow	0

i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
the kids play area is nasty	0
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does	0
great headset very impressed  h500	1

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach	0
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head  	1
no real improvement	0
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star  	1
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there  	1

perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this	0
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever	0
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad  	0

all three broke within two months of use	0
as for the service i thought it was good	1

the food is good	1
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12	0

the battery life is highly unacceptable	0
i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
we won't be going back	0

this is a great deal	1
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other  	1
this is a great phone	1

this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's  	1
battery has no life	0
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12	0
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying	0
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing	0
waste of money	0
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way	0
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed	0
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0
they refuse to refund or replace	0
it's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema  	1
this is infuriating	0
fast service	1
amazon sucks	0
couldn't use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas	0
omelets are to die for	1
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame  	1

wasted two hours  	0
boy was that sucker dry	0
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  	0
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses	0
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips	1
voice quality signal strength dropped calls	0
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	0
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver	1
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture  	0
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them	0
it wasn't busy either also the building was freezing cold	0

i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it	0
i thought it was bad  	0
i don't think i'll be running back to carly's anytime soon for food	0
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside	1
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  	1
will not be back	0
the film's dialogue is natural real to life  	1
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria	1
it's a great place and i highly recommend it	1
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section	1
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect	0
definitely worth checking out  	1
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous	1
this is a good battery and it got here really fast	1
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
lame would be the best way to describe it  	0
couldn't use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas	0
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review  	0
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid  	0
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning  	0
the script is horrendously stupid  	0
it is a very well acted and done tv movie  	1
i never walked out of a movie faster  	0
it is a really good show to watch  	1
pretty awesome place	1
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special	1

the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	0
it quit working after i'd used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset i've ever owned	1
needless to say i won't be going back anytime soon	0
 don't waste your time  	0
portable and it works	1
give this one a look  	1
its the best headset i have used	1
everything is appalling  	0
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  	0
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water	0
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other debits  	0
we loved the place	1
like the other reviewer said you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again	0
this place was such a nice surprise	1
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere	0
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed  	1
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up	0
service is friendly and inviting	1
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing  	0
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever  	0
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous  	0
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds	0
i especially love the long battery life	1
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem	1
there's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts  	1
it didn't charge for me	0
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous	1
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast  	1
dee snider just plain sucks  	0
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally	0
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie  	1
better than you'd expect	1
pretty piece of junk	0
good price	1
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us	0
it's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch  	1
this may be the only bad film he ever made  	0
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus  	0
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar	0
the fries were great too	1
has been working great	1
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons  	0
this product is very high quality chinese crap	0
it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen  	1
now i know that i made a wise decision	1
the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age  	1
i own 2 of these cases and would order another	1
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied	1
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot	1
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight	1
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish	1
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	0
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda  	0
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i	1
its the best headset i have used	1
they were excellent	1
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well	1
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman	1
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days	1
ordered a double cheeseburger  got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks	0
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot	1
this scene is very strong and unpleasant  	0
a standout scene  	1
poorly contstruct hinge	0
cant get the software to work with my computer	0
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes	0
he really didn't seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests  	0
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again	0
the nachos are a must have	1
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible	0
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears	0
this one just fails to create any real suspense  	0
i rate this movie 910  	1
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair	0
the jerky camera movements were also annoying  	0
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections  	1
very disappointing	0
i really liked that  	1
lightweight and works well	1
the soundtrack wasn't terrible either  	1
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle  	1
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat	1
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery	0
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  	0
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere  	0
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made  	1
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but i'm not inspired to go back	0
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive	1
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it  	1
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold	0
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent	1
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had	1
what the hell kind of crap is that  	0
awesome service and food	1
great for using with your home stereo	1
it was way over fried	0
the film has an ultracheap look to it  	0
50 down the drain	0
w810i is just superb	1
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miner's daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire  	1
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding  	0
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch	1
went in for happy hour great list of wines	1
the phone gets extremely hot	0
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i won't be back here because it is a convenient location	0

worked perfectly	1
razr battery  good buy	1
i give it 2 thumbs down	0
very pleased with this headset	1
that one didn't work either	0
the staff are also very friendly and efficient	1
i've bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these	0
my phone sounded ok  not great  ok but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldn't understand a word being said on it	0
i won't say any more  i don't like spoilers so i don't want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time  	1
if there is a wind it is completely useless	0
the script is horrendously stupid  	0
it is a joy to use	1
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think we'll just go to ninja sushi next time	0
there are some generally great things in it  	1
love it great armband	1
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom  	0
bad fit way too big	0
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then i'm lost	0
it has kept up very well	1
i've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me	1
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here  	0
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0
great choice	1
did not like at all	0
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast	1
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment  	0
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer	0
for that it's worth checking out  	1
dont waste your money	0
feelings thoughtsgabriel's discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal  	1
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike  	1
the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce  	0
i go to far too many places and i've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400	0
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons	0
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old  	1
i'm still infatuated with this phone	1
it isn't even an achievement as a sobadit'sgood or sobadit'smemorable movie  	0
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  	0
it's very slow  	0
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything	1
this may be the only bad film he ever made  	0
i advise everyone do not be fooled	0
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone  	0
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that	1
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script  	0
that's a huge design flaw unless i'm not using it correctly which i don't think is the case	0
comfort for our whole family	1
i used to talk on it for 1  1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying	0
light weight i hardly notice it is there	1
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste	1
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since	0
great hands free device	1
very dissapointing performance	0
however i needed some better instructions	0
the real disappointment was our waiter	0
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables	0
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7	1
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing	0
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable	1
piece of junk	0
service is also cute	1
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold	1
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and i took a good two hours to fully recover  	0
now this is a movie i really dislike  	0
started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters  	0
mishima is extremely uninteresting  	0
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best	0
but it is entertaining nonetheless  	1
meredith m was better than all right  	1
food was so gooodd	1
i great reception all the time	1
this was my first time and i can't wait until the next	1
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting  	1
the plantains were the worst i've ever tasted	0
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it	0
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot	1
easy to pair with my samsung cell	1
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film  	1
it was a waste of my money	0

phenomenal food service and ambiance	1
does not work	0
it doesn't make you look cool	0
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  	1
buy it play it enjoy it love it  	1
battery is terrible	0
about half way through this film i started to dislike it  	0
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service	1
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables	0
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting	1
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season  	0
basically the service was very bad	0
this place is two thumbs upway up	1
both do good jobs and are quite amusing  	1
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me	0
excellent wallet type phone case	1
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone	1
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse  	1
our server was super nice and checked on us many times	1
probably not in a hurry to go back	0
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated	0
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award  	1
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807	0
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree	1
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint	1
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda  	0
i will come back here every time i'm in vegas	1
three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen  	1
mic doesn't work	0
this movie is so awesome  	1
it's like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying	0
camerawork  again bad  	0
i usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight  doesn't mess up my hair	1
product is exactly as described	1
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like they're 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc  	0
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced	0
avoid this one if you can	0
it just blew  	0
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then i'm lost	0
also difficult to put oni'd recommend avoiding this product	0
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever  	0
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  	1
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money	0
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends	1
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history  	1
this fixes all the problems	1
overall a delight  	1
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with  	1
it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason  	0
everything is appalling  	0
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen  	1
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles  	1
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
good protection and does not make phone too bulky	1
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days	0
the food is about on par with denny's which is to say not good at all	0
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat	0
i don't think you will be disappointed  	1
this is not moviemaking  	0
after one bite i was hooked	1
unfortunately 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain  	0
camera color balance is awful	0
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one	0
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there  	0
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor  	1
as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it's frightening  	1
the acting sucked  	0
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left	0
on the up side their cafe serves really good food	1
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	0
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while	1
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened	0
the battery life is highly unacceptable	0
i'm not really sure how joey's was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine	0
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood	1
it was too predictable even for a chick flick  	0
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach	0
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended	1
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well  	1
he was terrible	0
my phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand	1
the selection was probably the worst i've seen in vegasthere was none	0
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression  	1
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot  	0
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars  	1
again lame  	0
we won't be returning	0
please dont waste your money	0
funny clever hip  just like pray's previous film hype  	1
very tough and very short on flavor	0
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking	0
everyone is treated equally special	1
woa talk about awful  	0
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action  	0
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film  	1
you won't regret it	1
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat	1
it has everything i need and i couldn't ask for more	1
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you won't be disappointed	1
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving  	0
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no	0
the ambiance was incredible	1
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience  	1
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film  	1
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon	0
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry  	1
go rent it  	1
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for	0
definitely will come back here again	1
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didn't overwhelm the soup	1
it was too predictable even for a chick flick  	0
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything	1
also difficult to put oni'd recommend avoiding this product	0
maybe it's just their vegetarian fare but i've been twice and i thought it was average at best	0
if you simply want a small flip phone  look elsewhere as the extra bells  whistles are mediocre	0
dessert panna cotta was amazing	1
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were	0
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone	1
sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering  	1
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm	1
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed	0
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very  appealing	0
best i've found so far  i've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using	1
the service was meh	0
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay	1
if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time  	0
i'm still infatuated with this phone	1
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant	1
i can't believe there's even a sequel to this  	0
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything  	1

gets the job done	1
this scene is very strong and unpleasant  	0
the service here is fair at best	0
you get what you pay for i guess	0
the food was great as always compliments to the chef	1
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  	1
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once	1
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave  	1
i've bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these	0
this may be the only bad film he ever made  	0
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume	0
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use	1
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world	1
the waitress and manager are so friendly	1
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom	0
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles	1
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	1
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	0
nothing at all to recommend  	0
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0
reception is terrible and full of static	0
clear crisp sound	1
it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to quality for if they did we'd have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess  	0
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful	1
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for  	0
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool	1
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you won't be disappointed	1
it's an empty hollow shell of a movie  	0
everything was good and tasty	1
i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking  	1
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating	0
he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money  	0
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed	0
i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like they're 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc  	0
i highly recommend this case	1
if you haven't gone here go now	1
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading	0
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down	0
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child  	1
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit	1
it quit working after i'd used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset i've ever owned	1
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem	0
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset	0
the reception has been generally good	1
we waited for forty five minutes in vain	0
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him	1
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it	0
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts	0
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better	0
she's poised and amazing  	1
the shipping time was also very quick	1
a greasy unhealthy meal	0
actually the graphics were good at the time  	1
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them	1
total brunch fail	0
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer	0
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great	1
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy	1
that company is a joke	0
will not be back	0
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try  	1
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws  	0
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish	1
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked  	0
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well	0
the cast was great  	1
don't buy it	0
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price	1
used and dirty	0
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it	0
my friend loved the salmon tartar	1
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that i've got it i couldn't be happier	1
definitely worth checking out  	1
comfort for our whole family	1
what a big waste of time	0
the reception is excellent	1
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems	0
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature	1
the script is a big flawed mess  	0

there's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before	0

it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs  	0
spend your money and time some place else	0
the movie seemed a little slow at first  	0
conclusion  i loved it  	1

i struggle to find anything bad to say about it  	1
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount	1
timely shipment and quality product	1

mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line  	1
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked	1
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back  	0

it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts  	1
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally	0

i've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear	0
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door	0

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds	0
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before  	0
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house	0
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old  	1
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work	0
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night  highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 	1
his performance as awarded was stunning  	1
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions  	1
i did not expect this to be so good	1
not even good for camp value  	0

great value	1
i rather enjoyed it  	1
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems	0
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day	0
unfortunately any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script  	0
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end  	1
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006  	1
well im satisfied	1

this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something	1
i was not impressed by this product	0
i go to far too many places and i've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400	0
it worked very well	1
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough	0
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon	1
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good	1
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good	1
this is a stunning movie  	1
i'll be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason	0
too bad cause i know it's family owned i really wanted to like this place	0
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show  	1
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding	1
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat	1
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it	0
needless to say we will never be back here again	0
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace  	0
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe  nice ambiance clean friendly staff	1
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi	1
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork	0
this place is two thumbs upway up	1
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known	0
we won't be going back	0
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa  is that the new phone on tv	1
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach	0
this battery is an excellent bargain	1
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes	0
is pretty funny  	1
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas	0
the dialogue sucked  	0
too bad cause i know it's family owned i really wanted to like this place	0
none of it works just don't buy it	0
these are the nicest restaurant owners i've ever come across	1
customer service was terrible	0
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well	1
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	1
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days	0
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	0
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds	0
delicious and i will absolutely be back	1
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived	0
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers	0
probably not in a hurry to go back	0
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza	1
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay	1
i am sorry i made this purchase	0
pretty awesome place	1
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family	1
it looked like a wonderful story  	1
the ending is so so perfect you'll shed a tear  	1
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone	1
i hate writing bad reviews about films  especially those in which i really like the star  but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it  	0
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water	0
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen	0
all i have to say is the food was amazing	1
the service was poor and thats being nice	0
i promise they won't disappoint	1
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears	1
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it  	0
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking	0
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note i'd love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones  	1
not a good bargain	0
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes	0
just what i wanted	1
a truly truly bad film  	0
the jerky camera movements were also annoying  	0
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean	1
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other  	1
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution	0
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call	0
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated	0
hands down my favorite italian restaurant	1
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone	0
we won't be going back	0
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart  	1
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were	0
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food	0
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore	0
really pleased with this product so far	1
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery  	0
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated	0
all in all i'm quite satisfied with this purchase	1
yeah the movie pretty much sucked  	0
bad fit way too big	0
great value	1
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord  	1
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1
very good lunch spot	1
top line don't waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes  	0
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles	0
the waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us	0
excellent bluetooth headset	1
the pizza selections are good	1
pretty piece of junk	0
dee snider just plain sucks  	0
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place	1
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced	0
great for using with your home stereo	1
the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right  	0
this game rocks  	1
i heart this place	1
exceptionally bad  	0
watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show  	0
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip	1
regrettably the film fails  	0
there is no plot or storyline  	0
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  	0
prosgood camera  very nice pictures  also has cool styles like black and white and more	1
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well	1
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional	1
all in all i'm quite satisfied with this purchase	1
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable  	0
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet	0
 don't waste your time  	0
everything was gross	0
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing	1
battery life is also great	1
 the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	1
i especially love the long battery life	1
she is as lovely as usual this cutie  	1
just spicy enough perfect actually	1
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid	1
avoid this one if you can	0
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible	1
i could care less the interior is just beautiful	1
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in	0
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work	0
it has all the features i want	1
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus  	0
will not be back	0
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered	0
it is zillion times away from reality  	0
everything is appalling  	0
great charger	1
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family  	1
the poor actors  	0
performed awful  muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call	0
which are small and not worth the price	0
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for  	0
still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow  	1
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat	0
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night  highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 	1
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot	1
very good stuff for the price	1
i won't be back	0
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	0
the reception is excellent	1
overall a delight  	1
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief  	0
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip	0
it is a really good show to watch  	1
i only used it two days and it wasn't always easy to hear with	0
very unreliable service from tmobile 	0
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant	1
it looks very nice	1
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series  	0
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best	0
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phone's autoanswer	1
i received it quickly and it works great	1
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists  	1
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid 750 to see this crap  	0
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other  	1
i'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have  	1
i'd rather eat airline food seriously	0
 they never brought a salad we asked for	0
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few  	1
i don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store it's not even a real movie  	0
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected	0
this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon	0
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries	0
utter crap sound quality is terrible	0
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made  	1
lame would be the best way to describe it  	0
worked perfectly	1
i hope this place sticks around	1
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure	1
this place lacked style	0
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing	0
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie  	0
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture  	0
kind of flops around	0
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process  	1
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family	1
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call	0
it isn't even an achievement as a sobadit'sgood or sobadit'smemorable movie  	0
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices	1
they know how to make them here	1
i took back my money and got outta there	0
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses	0
dessert panna cotta was amazing	1
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game  	1
ambience is perfect	1
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold	1
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  	0
this fixes all the problems	1
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films  	1
my first visit to hiro was a delight	1
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip	0
piece of trash	0
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  	0
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing	0
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack	0
being a 90's child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons  	1
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i don't care how cool it looks if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless	0
does everything it should and more	1
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me	0
don't bother coming here	0
their chow mein is so good	1
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake	0
then as if i hadn't wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check	0
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  	0
the concert sequences just sucked  	0
i love their fries and their beans	1
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage  	1
it really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down	0
i great reception all the time	1
the phone is sturdy and waterproof	1
it's the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher it's meanings  	1
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine  	1
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist  	0
 don't waste your time  	0
i can say that the desserts were yummy	1
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  	0
perfect for the ps3	1
you'll love how thin it is	1
and it was way to expensive	0
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  	0
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic  a real treat	1
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot  	0
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use	0
you'll love it  	1
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts	0
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting  	1
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot  	0
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times  	0
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	1
the lighting is awful  	0
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it	0
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i won't be going back	0
the acting sucked  	0
the cast is good  	1
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing	0
the bt headset was such a disapoinment	0
excellent product for the price	1
it wasn't busy either also the building was freezing cold	0
eew this location needs a complete overhaul	0
it's like a really sexy party in your mouth where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party	1
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all	0
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu	0
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful	1
magical help	1
here's where the movie really pied me off  	0
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected	0
there was nothing believable about it at all  	0
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixar's cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories  	1
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc	1
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  	0
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when i'm not wearing it	0
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process  	1
but i thought his acting was skilled  	1
the range is very decent i've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues	1
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep  	0
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears	1
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table	1
i hate writing bad reviews about films  especially those in which i really like the star  but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it  	0
this place should honestly be blown up	0
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while	0
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were	0
the mic is great	1
i will never forget it now  	1
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive	1
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser	1
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying	0
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding  	0
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others  	1
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real  	1
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldn't have even been created  	0
disappointed with battery	0
this place is two thumbs upway up	1

they have great dinners	1
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy	0

then the film just dropped the ball  	0
no plot whatsoever  	0
all in all i'd expected a better consumer experience from motorola	0
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement	0

the ending is so so perfect you'll shed a tear  	1
it shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs	0
rude  inconsiderate management	0
watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show  	0
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today	0
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper	1
it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'  	0
i just wanted to leave	0

three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen  	1
it isn't even an achievement as a sobadit'sgood or sobadit'smemorable movie  	0
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella the dead  	1
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review  	0
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low	0
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier	1

all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast  	1
i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull  	0
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did	1

it only recognizes the phone as its storage device	0
very good product well made	1
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it	1
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all  	0

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well  	1
the characters are interesting and you really care for them  	1
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i won't be going back	0
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon	1

i don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt	0
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews	1
very good product well made	1
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent	1

i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while	0
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue  	1
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is  	0

for service i give them no stars	0
the aerial scenes were welldone  	1
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing	1

one of my favorite purchases ever	1
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had	1
even worse than ticker  	0
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier	1
i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive  	0
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service	1
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it	0
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this	0

whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me  	0

great brunch spot	1
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion  	1
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public  	0
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  	1
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh	1
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized  	1

not good for the money	0
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn't receive and place calls	0
it's like a really sexy party in your mouth where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party	1
appetite instantly gone	0
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace  	0
worse there's an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	0
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it	1
it's really easy	1
not impressed	0
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys  	0
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh	1
much better than the hard plastic cases	1
i'm still trying to get over how bad it was  	0
and don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork  	0
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil	0
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made  	1
we aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just don't get itdefinitely lost the love after this one	0
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards  	0
the shrimp tender and moist	1
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts  	0
nice leather	1
but even the talented carrell can't save this  	0
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed	0
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast  	1
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem	0
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case	1
the block was amazing	1
i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style sensitivities and treatments  	1
it's a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver  	1
started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters  	0
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare	0
i connected my wife's bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case	1
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful	1
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent	1
very good lunch spot	1
my order was not correct	0
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food	0
the shipping time was also very quick	1
ordered a double cheeseburger  got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks	0
not as good as i had hoped	0
three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen  	1
there's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before	0
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever	0
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joe's glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene  	0
save your money i've had this item for 11 months now	0
 both the hot  sour  the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars	1
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission	1
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery	0
a good film by a great director  	1
the food wasn't good	0
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily	0
poorly contstruct hinge	0
also the area where my unit broke i'm not too fond of the magnetic strap	0
as for the service i thought it was good	1
i enjoyed it  	1
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last	0
do not make the same mistake as me	0
it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to quality for if they did we'd have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess  	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever	0
also makes it easier to hold on to	1
i hate writing bad reviews about films  especially those in which i really like the star  but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it  	0
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was  	1
waste of money	0
all in all i'm quite satisfied with this purchase	1
the only thing i wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as i don't like it pur√©ed	0
great food	1
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product	1
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family  	1
it's a piece of crap	0
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service	0
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  	1
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch  	1
same evening him and i are both drastically sick	0
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast	1
the cast is always entertaining as usual  	1
too bad cause i know it's family owned i really wanted to like this place	0
this is a great phone	1
excellent product for the price	1
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous	1
the chefs were friendly and did a good job	1
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up  	0
i can't use this case because the smell is disgusting	0
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome	0
i heart this place	1
on the up side their cafe serves really good food	1
the character developments also lacked in depth  	0
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap	0
this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon	0
each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious	1
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again	1
poor voice clarity	0
i cannot make calls at certain places	0
how can that bethe audio quality is poor	0
the food came out at a good pace	1
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  	0
he was terrible	0
save your money i've had this item for 11 months now	0
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold  	1
don't waste your money and time	0
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight	1
i love the camera it's really pretty good quality	1
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper	1
if you are reading this please don't go there	0
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick  	0
don't bother coming here	0
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie	1
too bad cause i know it's family owned i really wanted to like this place	0
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does	0
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful	1
awkward to use and unreliable	0
lightweight and works well	1
2 thumbs up	1
beautiful styling though	1
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see	1
poor quality	0
yes it's that bad  	0
we loved the place	1
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene  	1
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style	0
i'm a bit disappointed	0
do not make the same mistake as me	0
love the margaritas too	1
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call	0
terrible my car will not accept this cassette	0
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things	0
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it	0
it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy  	0
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale  	1
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever	0
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years  	1
graphics is far from the best part of the game  	0
think of the film being like a dream  	1
the cast is good  	1
poor quality and service	0
went for lunch  service was slow	0
i've had better bagels from the grocery store	0
1010  	1
don't waste your money	0
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for  	0
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing	0
i would not recommend this item to anyone	0
best breakfast buffet	1
on the up side their cafe serves really good food	1
same evening him and i are both drastically sick	0
i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there  	0
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late	0
the service was not up to par either	0
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place	1
works for me	1
i've had better bagels from the grocery store	0
overall i wasn't very impressed with noca	0
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced	0
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea	0
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy  	0
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat	0
the menu is always changing food quality is going down  service is extremely slow	0
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go  	0
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop	0
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep  	0
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake  	0
what did bother me was the slow service	0
great brunch spot	1
also difficult to put oni'd recommend avoiding this product	0
do not buy if you want to use the holster	0
cumbersome design	0
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off	0
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute	1
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if you're looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further  	1
great phone	1
it's just painful  	0
no buyers remorse on this one	0
they also have the best cheese crisp in town	1
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic  	0
again no plot at all  	0
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked	0
don't waste your  on this one	0
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with	1
not enough volume	0
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed	0
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time  	0
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative  	0
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas	1
not good by any stretch of the imagination	0
she's poised and amazing  	1
there is a brilliant twist ending  	1
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core  	0
the patio seating was very comfortable	1
ample portions and good prices	1
 the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	1
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching	1
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye  	1
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone	0
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well	1
i won't be back	0
thoroughly disappointed	0
 in fact it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself  	1
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr	0
dee snider just plain sucks  	0
we won't be going back	0
ray charles is legendary  	1
the worst phone i've ever had only had it for a few months	0
great case and price	1
i don't each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here	1
i won't say any more  i don't like spoilers so i don't want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time  	1
pretty awesome place	1
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  	0
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out  	0
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue  	1
i would recommend this	1
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor	1
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility  	1
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works  	1
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda	0
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think we'll just go to ninja sushi next time	0
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas	1
horrible phone	0
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers	1
i would not recommend this place	0
i am sorry i made this purchase	0
waste of 13 bucks	0
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed	0
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasn't great	0
nice headset priced right	1
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap	0
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams  	1
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb  complex  	1
the waitress and manager are so friendly	1
good protection and does not make phone too bulky	1
everything is appalling  	0
overall i wasn't very impressed with noca	0

nice design and quality	1
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted  	1

jabra ear gels r the best	1
save your money i've had this item for 11 months now	0
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service	1
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks  	0
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy  	0
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch  	1
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great	1
the food amazing	1
excellent short film  	1
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza	1
the inside is really quite nice and very clean	1
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded  	0
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work	0
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush it's amazing what they do with eggplant	1
i only hear garbage for audio	0
i cannot make calls at certain places	0
but it is great i would really recommend it	1
i would highly recommend this	1
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself	0

i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk  	0
we won't be returning	0
do not waste your money here	0
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles	0
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside  	0
good value works fine  power via usb car or wall outlet	1
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  	0
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone	0
it was absolutely amazing	1
bluetooth range is good  a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch	1
the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling  	0
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding	1
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike  	1
excellent sound quality	1
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot	1
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it	0
1 it works  2 it is comfortable	1
the film's dialogue is natural real to life  	1
this one is simply a disappointment	0
i couldn't think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy  	1
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  	1
this fixes all the problems	1
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it  	0
i'm very disappointed with my decision	0
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears	0
i do think tom hanks is a good actor  	1
definitely a bargain	1
can't upload ringtones from a third party	0
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem	1
the story line is just awful  	0
but i thought his acting was skilled  	1
food was average at best	0
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  	0
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown	0
after charging overnight these batteries work great	1
julian fellowes has triumphed again  	1
con spotty service	0
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm	1
it was pretty gross	0
i love this phone	1
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak i don't understand	0
i have recommended it to friends  	1
the live music on fridays totally blows	0
1010  	1
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem	0
the burger had absolutely no flavor  the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor	0
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat	0
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film  	1
extremely tasty	1
i wouldn't return	0
then as if i hadn't wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check	0
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design	0
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and that's right  	1
very very fun chef	1
the patio seating was very comfortable	1
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree	1
definitely not worth the 3 i paid	0
i don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea	1
no i'm going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it	0
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes	0
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didn't use my common sense	0
four stars for the food  the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe  still letting us in to eat 	1
don't bother coming here	0
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it	1
the chips and sals a here is amazing	1
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset	0
very dissapointing performance	0
the delivery was on time	1
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular	1
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it	0
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years  	1
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i don't expect any problems	1
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face  	1
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
a greasy unhealthy meal	0
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow	1
good audio quality	1
the burger had absolutely no flavor  the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor	0

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted  	1
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right	1
the battery runs down quickly	0
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful  	0
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didn't use my common sense	0
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's  	1
horrible  don't waste your time and money	0
a pretty good product	1
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	1
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone	0
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing	1
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0
the dialogue sucked  	0
light weight i hardly notice it is there	1
great phone	1
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it	1
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are	1
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop  	1
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead  	1
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point	0
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film  	1
linked to my phone without effort	1
very funny  	1
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy  	1
the staff are also very friendly and efficient	1
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle	1
great phone	1
i especially love the long battery life	1
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7	1
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place	1
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch  	1
disappointed	0
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20  left in the morning	0
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone	0
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful  	0
those phones are working just fine now	1
so far so good	1
i consider this theft	0
clear skype calls long battery life long range	1
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid 750 to see this crap  	0
the reception has been generally good	1
the kids are very cool too  	1
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish	0
works great	1
very good stuff for the price	1
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful	1
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing  	0
they refuse to refund or replace	0
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie  	0
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed	0
this movie is bad  	0
rating 1 out of 10  	0
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped	0
that was done in the second movie  	0
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to	1
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world	1
the delivery was on time	1
not too screamy not to masculine but just right  	1
there's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before	0
it felt too light and tinny	0
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 	0
the football scenes at the end were perplexing  	0
actually the graphics were good at the time  	1
probably not in a hurry to go back	0
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal	0
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve	1
it is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it	1
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles	0
we would recommend these to others	1
works well	1
his performance is simply genius  	1
this was like the final blow	0
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while	1
this fixes all the problems	1
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible	0
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times  	0
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks  	0
awesome device	1
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions	1
each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious	1
but this movie really got to me  	1
i thought it was bad  	0
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value	1
the fried rice was dry as well	0
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with  	1
these are the nicest restaurant owners i've ever come across	1
as many people complained i found this headset's microphone was very weak	0
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored	1
disapointing results	0
there is a brilliant twist ending  	1
works for me	1
lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age  	0
and then tragedy struck	0
some highlights  great quality nigiri here	1
it's very slow  	0
i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking  	1
there were too many close ups  	0
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  	1
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best	1
everything was perfect the night we were in	1
i highly recommend this device to everyone	1
if there is a wind it is completely useless	0
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen  	1
for the price this was a great deal	1
i also had to taste my mom's multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious	1
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	1
 but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies  	0
go and see it  	1
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch  	1
i got food poisoning here at the buffet	0
buttons are too small	0
the chips and sals a here is amazing	1
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it	0
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold	1
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me  	0
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty	1
the story line is just awful  	0
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative	1
i was seated immediately	1
don't buy it	0
we've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant	0
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist  	1
i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style sensitivities and treatments  	1
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie  	1
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset	0
the reception has been generally good	1
customer service was terrible	0
very pleased with this headset	1
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear	0
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try	1
worst thai ever	0
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love  	1
nice leather	1
eclectic selection	1
