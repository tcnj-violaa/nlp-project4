very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment  	0
it was so cool  	1
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism  	1
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe  nice ambiance clean friendly staff	1
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up	1
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs  	0
you can watch them preparing the delicious food	1
great product and price	1
woa talk about awful  	0
poor voice clarity	0
great food and awesome service	1
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child  	1

food was below average	0
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would	0

cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item	1
fantastic food	1
total waste of time	0
you can watch them preparing the delicious food	1
best tacos in town by far	1
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs	0
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom	0
i've never been more insulted or felt disrespected	0
beautiful styling though	1
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor pizza hut coupons	0
it is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  	1
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare	0
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this  	0
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didn't use my common sense	0
interesting decor	1
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous	1

kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did	0
the service was poor and thats being nice	0

great charger	1
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing  	0
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is  	0
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more	0
awesome device	1
it's not hard to make a decent hamburger	0
great product	1
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally	0
it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time  	1
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon	0
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work	0
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake  	0
would not reccommend	0
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear	0
excellent bluetooth headset	1
very disappointed	0
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts  	1
awful  	0
the food was terrible	0
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem	0

this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts  	1
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  	0
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go  	1
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria	1
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide	1
the service was not up to par either	0
maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible	0
it isn't even an achievement as a sobadit'sgood or sobadit'smemorable movie  	0
i'm not really sure how joey's was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine	0
i'll even say it again  this is torture  	0

i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list	0
the plug did not work very well	0
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed	1
didn't laugh or even smile once  	0
maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible	0
it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work  	1
this device is great in several situations1	1
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish	1
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip	1
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything	0
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid	1
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  	0
i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking  	1
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer	1
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage  	1
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him	1
i went on motorola's website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again	0
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here	0
his performance is simply genius  	1
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's  	1
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc	0
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold	0
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through  	0
same evening him and i are both drastically sick	0
worse there's an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	0
restored my phone to like new performance	1
it's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema  	1

we definately enjoyed ourselves	1
very disappointed in accessoryone	0
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good	0

three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen  	1
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player	0
i was mortified	0
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great	1
this is a good joint	1
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this	0
i didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me	0
lightweight and works well	1
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible	0
i got food poisoning here at the buffet	0
the aerial scenes were welldone  	1
i've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one i've found that fits my ear comfortably	1
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors	1
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant	0
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything	1
it was way over fried	0
i was not happy with this item	0
great phone	1
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized  	1
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it  	1
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful	1
it is shameful  	0
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service	1
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever	0
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully	1
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears	1
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous	1
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense  	0
very disappointing	0

but even the talented carrell can't save this  	0
great phone	1

just what i wanted	1
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great	1

the characters are interesting and you really care for them  	1
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only	0
will be back again	1
i would highly recommend this product	1
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	0
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad  	0
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip	0
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food	0
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely  	0
everything was good and tasty	1
phenomenal food service and ambiance	1
on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  	0
also difficult to put oni'd recommend avoiding this product	0
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20  left in the morning	0
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed  	1
timely shipment and quality product	1
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
the warm beer didn't help	0
so just beware	0
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart  	1
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue  	1
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman	1
i highly recommend this device to everyone	1
we are so glad we found this place	1
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking  	1

it's aggravating	0
i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk  	0
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected	0
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it  	1
but the service was beyond bad	0
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service	1
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then i'm lost	0

saggy floppy piece of junk	0
the bartender was also nice	1
the service was extremely slow	0
basically the service was very bad	0

hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  	0
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting	1
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture  	0
but then they came back cold	0
i would recommend this	1
what a waste of money and time	0
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed  	0
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone	0
not tasty and the texture was just nasty	0
needless to say we will never be back here again	0
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job  	1
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead  	1
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen  	0

this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone	0
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging	1

if you act in such a film you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible  	0
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad	0
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well	1
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans  	1
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman	1
that just screams legit in my booksomethat's also pretty rare here in vegas	1
i highly recommend this device to everyone	1
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular	1
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy  	1
he was terrible	0
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art  	1
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real  	1
the plug did not work very well	0
worth every penny	1
my gyro was basically lettuce only	0
the movie seemed a little slow at first  	0
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers  	1
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back	1
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me	0
penne vodka excellent	1
but it picked up speed and got right to the point  	1
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted  	1
the football scenes at the end were perplexing  	0
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see	0
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative	1
probably not in a hurry to go back	0
i don't think i'll be running back to carly's anytime soon for food	0
this product is very high quality chinese crap	0

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing	0
my phone sounded ok  not great  ok but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldn't understand a word being said on it	0
worse there's an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	0
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it  	1
i dressed up to be treated so rudely	0
i won't be back	0
nice design and quality	1
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom	0
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers  	1
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting  	1
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcit's all wrong  	0
can't store anything but phone numbers to sim	0
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff	1
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside	1
this is infuriating	0
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear	0
you can't relate with them hell you barely can understand them  	0
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch  	1
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it  	1
very easy to use	1
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery	0
after charging overnight these batteries work great	1
i highly recommend this device to everyone	1

the jerky camera movements were also annoying  	0
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white lowbudget original  	1
doesn't work	0
i found the product to be easy to set up and use	1
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807	0
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world	1
made very sturdy	1
the inside is really quite nice and very clean	1
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game  	1
has been working great	1
some highlights  great quality nigiri here	1
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us  	0
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well	1
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature	1
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular	1

this place is disgusting	0
some highlights  great quality nigiri here	1
their steaks are 100 recommended	1
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked  	0
don't waste your money	0
also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design  costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar  	1
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal	0
the worst was the salmon sashimi	0
this is an extraordinary film  	1
 both the hot  sour  the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars	1
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack	0
could not get strong enough signal	0
his performance as awarded was stunning  	1
avoid this film at all costs  	0
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous  	0
it was not good	0
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life  	0
after 20 minutes wait i got a table	0
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman	1
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  	1
what a waste of money and time	0
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back  	0
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	1
i didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious	1
this one just fails to create any real suspense  	0
i'm super pissd	0
there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible  	0
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked	0
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish	1
i will come back here every time i'm in vegas	1
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way  	1
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone	0
over rated	0
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon	0
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home	0
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well  	1
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount	1
the service was terrible though	0
it's just lame  	0
the waitresses are very friendly	1
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great	1
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today	0
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue  	1
it was way over fried	0
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse  	0
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time	1
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game  	1
could not get strong enough signal	0

incredible	1
poor quality and service	0

the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age  	1
four stars for the food  the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe  still letting us in to eat 	1
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish	1
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use	0
don't buy it	0
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because there's nothing lower  	0
and quite honestly often its not very good  	0
not good by any stretch of the imagination	0
i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasn't high priced	1
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas	1
i'd advise anyone to go and see it  	1
this movie is terrible  	0
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm	0
a fly was in my apple juice a fly	0
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed	1
also makes it easier to hold on to	1
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others  	1
i like armand assante  my cable company's summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again  	1
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from	1
i love their fries and their beans	1
probably never coming back and wouldn't recommend it	0
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off	0
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it	0
restored my phone to like new performance	1
it's a piece of crap	0
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless	0
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen  	0
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant	1
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it	1
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing	1
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic  	0
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale  	1
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds	0
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy  	0
useless phone simply deaf	0
lasted one day and then blew up	0
unfortunately 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain  	0
i couldn't think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy  	1
i won't be back	0
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush it's amazing what they do with eggplant	1
all in all i think it was a good investment	1
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series  	1
battery has no life	0
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi	1
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily	0
incredible	1
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever	0
it wasn't busy at all and now we know why	0
the aerial scenes were welldone  	1
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way	0
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever  	1
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other  	1
really awful  	0
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus  	0
his performance as awarded was stunning  	1
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service	1
these are the nicest restaurant owners i've ever come across	1
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets  	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking  	0
food quality has been horrible	0
battery life is real good	1
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing  	0
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere	1
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint	0

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet	0

excellent sound quality	1
it's an empty hollow shell of a movie  	0
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal	1
the plot  well i said i'd let that one go  	0
but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn  	0
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again	0
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with	0
the story is also both funny and poignant at times  	1
the story itself is just predictable and lazy  	0
it was just not a fun experience	1
great sound and service	1
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts	0
this place receives stars for their appetizers	1

very slow at seating even with reservation	0
the worst was the salmon sashimi	0

i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes	1

don't buy it	0
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but i'm not inspired to go back	0

the worst phone i've ever had only had it for a few months	0
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally	0
prosgood camera  very nice pictures  also has cool styles like black and white and more	1
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution	0
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends  	1
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced	0
i'll give this film 10 out of 10  	1
i am glad i purchased it	1
great phone	1
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section	1
no buyers remorse on this one	0
definitely not worth the 3 i paid	0
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	1
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either	0
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking	0

i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush it's amazing what they do with eggplant	1
the staff are great the ambiance is great	1
low quality	0
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent  	1
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great	1
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality	1

soggy and not good	0
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on  	0

damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen  	1

bad characters bad story and bad acting  	0
soyo technology sucks	0

unfortunately it did not work	0
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional	1

clear skype calls long battery life long range	1
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was	1
setup couldn't have been simpler	1
this movie is bad  	0
the instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used	0
there are some generally great things in it  	1
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is  	0
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service	1
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way  	0
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last	0
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier	1
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking	0
it does everything the description said it would	1
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place	0
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  	1
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers	0
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful  	0
which are small and not worth the price	0
the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age  	1
i liked it  	1
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
its a total package	1
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal	1
couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal	1
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic  a real treat	1
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it	0

what a waste of time	0
the staff was very attentive	1
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself  	1
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days	0
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you	0
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad	0
it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time  	1
we definately enjoyed ourselves	1
a pretty good product	1
the kids play area is nasty	0
i only used it two days and it wasn't always easy to hear with	0

lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers	1
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it  	0
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well	1
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product	1
i give it 2 thumbs down	0
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced	0
the real disappointment was our waiter	0
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good	1

very disappointing	0
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas	0
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors i'd rather be using a disposable then this	0
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie  	0
the han nan chicken was also very tasty	1
useless phone simply deaf	0
worst customer service ever	0
not good for the money	0
food was delicious	1
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
good show samsung	1
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away	1

my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this	0
great pizza and salads	1
i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone  	0
also great directing and photography  	1
really ugly	0
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards  	0
don't waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film  	0
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me	0
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game  	1

it's not what it says it is	0
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way	0
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point	0
excellently produced by one of scifi's best producers scot vandiver   	1
i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull  	0
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord  	1
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine  	1
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had	1
the movie showed a lot of florida at it's best made it look very appealing  	1
the waitress and manager are so friendly	1
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute	1

the film lacks any real scares or tension  some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least  i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself  	0
oh the charger seems to work fine	1
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying	0
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way  	1
waited 2 hours  never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did	0

the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown	0
the food was great as always compliments to the chef	1
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale	0
awful  	0
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all  	0
better than you'd expect	1
thoroughly disappointed	0
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap  	0
would not go back	0
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  	0
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia	1
awkward to use and unreliable	0
if you want a real scare rent this one  	1
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma	1

the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful	1
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed	1

this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public  	0
spend your money elsewhere	0

waiter was a jerk	0
its not user friendly	0
i never walked out of a movie faster  	0

great subway in fact it's so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations	1
we are so glad we found this place	1
don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support	0
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount	0
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  	0
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers  	1
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  	1
very good product well made	1
it's fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable	1
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing  	0
if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time  	0

about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts  	0
i would not recommend this place	0
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them	0
first  the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished  just plain yucky	0
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast  	0
worthwhile	1
the soundtrack sucked  	0
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me	0
the food is good	1
it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy  	0
there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible  	0
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world	1

everyone is treated equally special	1
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tv's	1
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome	0
poor quality and service	0
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful	1

my friend did not like his bloody mary	0
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games	0

one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  	0
i received it quickly and it works great	1
the phone loads super	1
we enjoy their pizza and brunch	1
the service was extremely slow	0
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think we'll just go to ninja sushi next time	0

before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review	0
does not work	0
sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering  	1
we won't be going back anytime soon	0
awful  	0
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre  	1
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone	0
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product	1
good product good seller	1
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	0
terrible service	0
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me  	0
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds	0
the inside is really quite nice and very clean	1
both do good jobs and are quite amusing  	1
the service was outshining  i definitely recommend the halibut	1
extremely tasty	1
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable	1
buyerbe very careful	0
then there's the plot holes  	0
i'm pleased	1
it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to quality for if they did we'd have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess  	0
great pork sandwich	1
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up	0

they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything i've tried gets my seal of approval	1
 really really good rice all the time	1
this is just a great movie  	1
everything was fresh and delicious	1
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's upandcoming	1
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use	0
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and i'm glad i did	1
trumbull on i love lucy  	1
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder  	0
the script iswas there a script  	0
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first	0
over rated	0
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is  	1
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner	1
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film  	1
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged	0
nothing at all to recommend  	0
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table	1
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  	0
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  	0
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated	0
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service	1
but then they came back cold	0
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery	0
this is actually a very smart movie  	1
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise	0
very pleased with this headset	1
but tiny toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created  	1
easy to pair with my samsung cell	1
i don't each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here	1
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema  	1
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family  	1
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great	1
it was absolutely amazing	1
i was so insulted	0

the service here is fair at best	0
all in all i think it was a good investment	1
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious	1
food was great and so was the serivce	1
nothing at all to recommend  	0
performed awful  muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call	0
earbud piece breaks easily	0
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that i've tried so far and they're all good	1
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care	1
if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time  	0
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well  	1
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call	0
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service	0
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems	1
painful on the ear	0
come hungry leave happy and stuffed	1
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold  	1
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didn't overwhelm the soup	1
great sound and service	1
timely shipment and quality product	1
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it  	1
the ambiance was incredible	1
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers  	1
the buttons for on and off are bad	0
would not recommend to others	0
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before  	1
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone  	0
used and dirty	0
it's dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time  	0
i don't think i've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much  	0
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast	1
i gave it 5 stars then and i'm giving it 5 stars now	1
a truly truly bad film  	0
comfort for our whole family	1
excellent bluetooth headset	1
the service was not up to par either	0
the shrimp tender and moist	1
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish	1
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion  	1
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes	0
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well	0
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing	0
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop	0
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene  	0
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse  	0
it was pretty gross	0
the turkey and roast beef were bland	0
it is an insane game  	1
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  	1
the burger is good beef cooked just right	1
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i don't expect any problems	1
big disappointment with calendar sync	0
comfort for our whole family	1
they work about 2 weeks then break	0
again lame  	0
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night  highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 	1
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it	1
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer	0
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted  	0
waitress was a little slow in service	0
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone	0
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data	0
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
definitely will come back here again	1

after charging overnight these batteries work great	1
i would highly recommend this product	1

blue ant is easy to use	1
you'll love how thin it is	1
good value works fine  power via usb car or wall outlet	1
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day	0
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back  	0
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens	0
great sound and service	1
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon	0
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from	1
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well	1
brilliance indeed  	1
i will never forget it now  	1
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland	0
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow	1
the service was not up to par either	0
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries i've ever had	0
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor  	1
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there  	1
i'd advise anyone to go and see it  	1
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak i don't understand	0
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced	1
what happened next was prettyoff putting	0
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film  	0
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register	0
i've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one i've found that fits my ear comfortably	1
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh	1
i didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious	1
i was very disappointed	0
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too  	0
cumbersome design	0
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack	0
my first visit to hiro was a delight	1
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and i took a good two hours to fully recover  	0
the mic is great	1
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place	1
this movie has a cutting edge to it  	1
there's really nothing bad i can say about this headset	0
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed	1
everything stinks  	0
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars  	1
the service was terrible food was mediocre	0
voice quality signal strength dropped calls	0
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy  	0
the plug did not work very well	0
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever  	1
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally	0
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up	0
the real disappointment was our waiter	0
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi	1
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  	1
defective crap	0
i hope this place sticks around	1
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree	1
too bad you have to pay up to  a month for the service	0
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat	0
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	0
they do not care about the consumer one bit	0
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened	0
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  	0
i don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake  	0
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar	1
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions  	1
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever  	1
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace  	0
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy  	0
and those baby owls were adorable  	1
of course the acting is blah  	0
will order from them again	1
 the food is rich so order accordingly	1
doesn't work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working	0
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	1
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product	1
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing	0
this movie is bad  	0
it's aggravating	0
it is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it	1
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude	0
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phone's autoanswer	1
my first visit to hiro was a delight	1
food was really boring	0
i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there  	0
great value	1
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive	1
gets the job done	1
the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce  	0
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking  	1
having trouble with volume	0
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more  	0
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
service was fantastic	1
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  	1
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us	0
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom  	0
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasn't great	0
will not be back	0
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed	0
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible	1
this place is great	1
i would not recommend this place	0
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary	0
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered	0
it was horrendous  	0
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real  	1
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world	1
think of the film being like a dream  	1
also difficult to put oni'd recommend avoiding this product	0
it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films  	0
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again	0
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made	1
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and that's right  	1
these are the nicest restaurant owners i've ever come across	1
this is a good joint	1
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive	1
graphics is far from the best part of the game  	0
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures  	0
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears	1
it's pretty easy	1
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal	0
the kids are annoying  	0
not good enough for the price	0
prosgood camera  very nice pictures  also has cool styles like black and white and more	1
the plantains were the worst i've ever tasted	0
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts  	0
disappointed with battery	0
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything	0
the food wasn't good	0
i wish i could enter negative values admins  	0
also great directing and photography  	1
this place is amazing	1
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  	1
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service	0
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten	1
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside  	0
 anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot  	1
i went to bachi burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed	1
however i needed some better instructions	0
definitely worth checking out  	1
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount	1
great earpiece	1
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try  	1
nice docking station for home or work	1
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  	0
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen	1
is pretty funny  	1
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	0
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount	0
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well	0
iam very pleased with my purchase	1
omg the food was delicioso	1
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs  	1
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere	0
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas	0
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside	1
about half way through this film i started to dislike it  	0
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons  	0
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices	1
everything from acting to cinematography was solid  	1
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with	0
worst foodservice i've had in a while	0
i promise they won't disappoint	1
he deserves 5 stars	1
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
great bluetooth	1
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week  but still lasts longer than thereplacement	0
the portion was huge	1
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked	0
the film looks cheap and bland  	0
lange had become a great actress  	1
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing	0
i didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes  	1
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear	0
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldn't produce my receipt i was out of luck	0
lasted one day and then blew up	0
couldn't figure it out	0
pretty good beer selection too	1
worthwhile	1
1010  	1
if the food isn't bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world's worstannoying drunk people	0
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only	0
very much disappointed with this company	0
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking	0
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect	0
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off	0
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool	1
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tv's	1
we waited for forty five minutes in vain	0
the kids play area is nasty	0
do not purchase this phone	0
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too	0
i will never forget it now  	1
waiter was a jerk	0
their research and development division obviously knows what they're doing	1
great phone	1
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us	0
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work	0
not impressed	0
great food	1
good food  good service 	1
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman	1
this movie is also revealing  	1
the construction of the headsets is poor	0
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa  	1
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  	0
four stars for the food  the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe  still letting us in to eat 	1
i didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious	1
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear	0
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again	1
the phone was unusable and was not new	0
20th century fox's road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie  	0
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat	0
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with	1
good value great food great service	1
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas	1
they refuse to refund or replace	0
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective  	1
great value	1
best headset ever	1
highly recommended	1
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us	0
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma	1
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would	0
the budget was evidently very limited  	0
great pizza and salads	1
great for the jawbone	1
what a waste of time	0
we won't be going back	0
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  	0
mishima is extremely uninteresting  	0
each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious	1
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film  	1
terrible product and waste of money	0
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america  	0
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table	1
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far	1
how stupid is that	0
restored my phone to like new performance	1
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management	0
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful  	0
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there	1
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me	0
my headset works just peachykeen	1
it's worth driving up from tucson	1
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one	1
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate  	1
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried	1
totally believable  	1
what a big waste of time	0
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent  	1
you won't forget this movie  	1
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film  	1
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care  	1
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon	0
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home	0
battery is terrible	0
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like they're 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc  	0
filmiing was less expansive  	0
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal	1
i liked this movie way too much  	1
would recommend this item	1
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure	1
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection	1
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff	1
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad	1
i'd love to go back	1
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat	1
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert	0
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcit's all wrong  	0
that was done in the second movie  	0
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice	0
sooooo good	1
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work	0
so just beware	0
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists  	1
we were promptly greeted and seated	1
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does	0
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it	0
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very  appealing	0
bluetooth range is good  a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch	1
no real improvement	0
the service was a bit lacking	0
best tater tots in the southwest	1
what i really like there is the crepe station	1
mediocre food	0
the burger had absolutely no flavor  the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor	0
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible	1
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone	1
i couldn't think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy  	1
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem  	1
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue  	0
bad characters bad story and bad acting  	0
also the story and acting were weak  	0
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back	1
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying	0
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome	0
needless to say i won't be going back anytime soon	0
nothing at all to recommend  	0
i love this thing	1
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not	0
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone	0
it is simple to use and i like it	1
the chefs were friendly and did a good job	1

the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim  	1

after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset	0
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is  	1

the bus boy on the other hand was so rude	0
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
the food is about on par with denny's which is to say not good at all	0

the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint	0
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc	1

would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas	1
i can assure you that you won't be disappointed	1
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  	1
attempting artiness with black  white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed  became even more ridiculous  as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent  	0
this place receives stars for their appetizers	1
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7	1
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger	0
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland	0

i would not recommend this item to anyone	0
watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show  	0
gets a signal when other verizon phones won't	1
i had a pretty satifying experience	1
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night  	1
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
the character developments also lacked in depth  	0
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next  	1
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits	0
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  	1
the veggitarian platter is out of this world	1
interesting decor	1
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative	1

really ugly	0
i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie  	0
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service	0

yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design	0
works well	1
nice case feels good in your hands	1
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back  	0

i'm a bit disappointed	0
i was not happy with this item	0
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks	0
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldn't eat here again	0
this is an extraordinary film  	1
what a waste	0
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known	0
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn  	1
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	1
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar	1
my friend loved the salmon tartar	1
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans  	1
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real  	1
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again  	1
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen	0
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor  	1
also difficult to put oni'd recommend avoiding this product	0
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside  	0
too bad you have to pay up to  a month for the service	0
defective crap	0
we will not be coming back	0

i love lane but i've never seen her in a movie this lousy  	0
i am glad i purchased it	1
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone	0
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen	0
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon	1
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  	0
painful on the ear	0
no ear loop needed it's tiny and the sound is great	1
there were too many close ups  	0
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldn't eat here again	0
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back  	0
the concert sequences just sucked  	0
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood	1
great food and awesome service	1
good audio quality	1
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever  	0
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  	0
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food	0
this was like the final blow	0
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars	0
but this movie is definitely a below average rent  	0
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas	0
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach	0
i wouldn't return	0
the cast is always entertaining as usual  	1
i was not impressed by this product	0
it was equally awful	0
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts	0
babie bop is very cute  	1
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it	0
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film  	1
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it	1
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it	0
fantastic earphones	1
it's a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this  	0
i will not be eating there again	0
it has been a winner for us	1
dessert panna cotta was amazing	1
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty  	0
this is not moviemaking  	0
go to place for gyros	1
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it  	1
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible	1
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up  	0
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
it didn't charge for me	0
the instruction manual is lacking	0
great bluetooth	1
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage	0
the results well are a shame  	0
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  	0
we loved the place	1
i don't know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories  	1
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company	0
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper	1
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works  	1
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries	0
highly recommended	1
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus  	0
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small	0
honeslty it didn't taste that fresh	0
we'd definitely go back here again	1
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too  	0
it looks very nice	1
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  	0
three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen  	1
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed	1
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 	1
what the hell kind of crap is that  	0
the phone gets extremely hot	0
long whiny and pointless  	0
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer	0
and don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork  	0
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience  	1
food was really boring	0
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus	1
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low	0
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it	1
great food	1
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film  	1
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone	0
nice spicy and tender	1
buy a different phone  but not this	0
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear	0
what a disappointment	0
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end	1
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design	0
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it	1
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda  	0
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed	0
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place	1
i loved the bacon wrapped dates	1
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution	0
worst foodservice i've had in a while	0
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure  	0
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money	1
i don't think i'll be running back to carly's anytime soon for food	0
the worst phone i've ever had only had it for a few months	0
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked	1
of course the acting is blah  	0
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film  	1
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were  	0
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate	0
wow loved this place	1
crostini that came with the salad was stale	0
much better than the hard plastic cases	1
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time	1
i'd love to go back	1
razr battery  good buy	1
first of all it doesn't wear well	0
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead	1
it's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg	0
the directing seems too pretentious  	0
setup went very smoothly	1
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron	0
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love	1
very disappointed in accessoryone	0
aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other debits  	0
very bad experience	0
i received it quickly and it works great	1
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list	0
for that it's worth checking out  	1
the fries were great too	1
now i know that i made a wise decision	1
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast	1
the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling  	0
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends  	1
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration	0
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case	1
i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk  	0
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality	1
the plantains were the worst i've ever tasted	0
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style  	1
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid  	0
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up	1
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  	0
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left	0
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late	0
overall a great experience	1
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face  	1
i loved the bacon wrapped dates	1
all in all i think it was a good investment	1
i wasn't the least bit interested  	0
the lighting is awful  	0
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job  	1
rip off over charge shipping	0
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger	0
no real improvement	0
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section	1
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it	0
looks great and is strong	1
my rating just 3 out of 10  	0
the best part about nurse betty is it's unpredictability  	1
not a good bargain	0
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake  	0
if someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart	0

in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast  	1

highly entertaining at all angles  	1
this place has it	1
i do think tom hanks is a good actor  	1
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care  	1
i wouldnt see this movie again for free  	0
rating 1 out of 10  	0

perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this	0
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious	1
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
great audio	1
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate  	1
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep  	0
pretty awesome place	1
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food	0
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul	1
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections  	1
amazon sucks	0
the football scenes at the end were perplexing  	0
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone	0
on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  	0
battery is terrible	0
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons	0
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles  	1
i'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have  	1
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  	0
what a disappointment	0
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything	0
the food was terrible	0
go to place for gyros	1
overall i wasn't very impressed with noca	0
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	1
waste of 13 bucks	0
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic  a real treat	1
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time	1
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today  	1
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night  	1
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	1
it's a sad movie but very good  	1
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks  	0

none of them are engaging or exciting  	0
worst martini ever	0
the reception is excellent	1
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience  	0
great pork sandwich	1
it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work  	1
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers	1
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldn't eat here again	0
extremely tasty	1
very disappointed in accessoryone	0
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn  	1

a truly truly bad film  	0
worthless product	0

this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use	0
awful service	0

i enjoyed it  	1
a bit predictable  	0
i used to talk on it for 1  1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying	0

don't buy it	0
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable  	0
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite	1
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it	1
the food was great as always compliments to the chef	1
sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering  	1
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame  	1
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi	1
so they performed	1
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had	1
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs  	0
the food amazing	1
nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes  	0
i would recommend this	1
it's close to my house it's lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food	1
went in for happy hour great list of wines	1
do not waste your money here	0
lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly won't allow  	0
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1
it doesn't work in europe or asia	0
it really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down	0
waitress was a little slow in service	0

setup couldn't have been simpler	1
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad	0
if someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart	0
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character  	1
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself	0

brilliant  	1
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20  left in the morning	0
it's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage  	0
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans  	1

i received it quickly and it works great	1
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it	1
horrible  	0
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it  	0
we waited for forty five minutes in vain	0
it wasn't busy either also the building was freezing cold	0
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted	0
needless to say we will never be back here again	0

no i'm going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it	0
i love this phone	1
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie  	1
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful	1
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service	1
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude	0
it's like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier	1
the design is very good4	1
the very idea of it was lame  take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie  	0
this one is simply a disappointment	0
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one	1
same problem as others have mentioned	0
couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal	1
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  	1
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible	0
excellent sound quality	1
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet	0
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through  	0
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i won't spoil it  	1
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus	1
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service	1

it's worth driving up from tucson	1
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too	0
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts	1
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen  	0
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly	1
fans of the genre will be in heaven  	1
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake  	0
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back  	0
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving  	0
i advise everyone do not be fooled	0
i came out of it feeling angry  	0

terrible service	0
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist  	1
the selection of food was not the best	0
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door	0
what this film lacks is a convincing script  	0
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget  	1
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good	1
while you don't yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928  	1

everything about this movie is stupid  	0
please dont waste your money	0
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems	0

very funny  	1
everything about this film is simply incredible  	1

i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there  	0
i literally vomited while watching this film  	0
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude	1
exactly what i wanted	1
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations it's an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience  	1
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to	1
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place  	0
plug was the wrong size	0
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad	0
really bad  	0
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show  	0
the selection was probably the worst i've seen in vegasthere was none	0
eew this location needs a complete overhaul	0
we will not be coming back	0
there were too many close ups  	0

i wear glasses and it fits fine with them	1
it's a piece of crap	0
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service	1

unfortunately any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script  	0
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda	0
ray charles is legendary  	1
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene  	0
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way  	0
you can't relate with them hell you barely can understand them  	0
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing  	0
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly	0
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop	0
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and i'm glad i did	1
same problem as others have mentioned	0
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery	0
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner	1
always a great time at dos gringos	1
audio quality is poor very poor	0
i had a pretty satifying experience	1
it's pretty easy	1
this place is disgusting	0
my gyro was basically lettuce only	0
it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie  	1
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting	0
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face	0
not sure who was more lost  the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out  	0
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but i'm not inspired to go back	0
i also had to taste my mom's multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious	1
it is worth the drive	1
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop	0
worked great	1
i would recommend this	1
mic doesn't work	0

john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry  	1

lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave  	1
i've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me	1
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixar's cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories  	1
waitress was good though	1
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service	1
camerawork  again bad  	0
love this headset	1
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom	0
the cast was great  	1
i gave it 5 stars then and i'm giving it 5 stars now	1
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
it was forced like everything in this movie  	0
bad reception	0
sweetest phone	1
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism  	1
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good  	0
again lame  	0
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show  	0
camera color balance is awful	0
absolutel junk	0
the kids play area is nasty	0

my order was not correct	0
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys  	0
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time i'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago	1
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended	1
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for  	0
it is very comfortable on the ear	1
very comfortable	1
it worked very well	1
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  	1
one of my favorite purchases ever	1
i consider this theft	0
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it	0
the food was terrible	0
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0
those phones are working just fine now	1
2 thumbs up to this seller	1
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom	0
the service was a bit lacking	0
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell  	0
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didn't use my common sense	0
best i've found so far  i've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using	1
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note i'd love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones  	1
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up	1
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective  	1
talk about great customer service of course we will be back	1
the waitresses are very friendly	1
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone	0
delicious and i will absolutely be back	1
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more  	0
great phone	1
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up	0
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one	0
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way  	0
he can't act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he can't write did he write this damn movie in his sleep  	0
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen  	1
this place is great	1
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time i'm in vegas	1
the food is about on par with denny's which is to say not good at all	0
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad  	0
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree	1
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things	0
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery	0
rating 1 out of 10  	0
nice headset priced right	1
brilliance indeed  	1
too bad cause i know it's family owned i really wanted to like this place	0
very easy to use	1
we are sending it back	0
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake	0
the battery life is highly unacceptable	0
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver	1
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film  	1
the visual effects were awful  	0
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera  	1
i'm not eating here	0
this place is horrible and way overpriced	0
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action  	0
the real disappointment was our waiter	0
no i'm going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it	0
i really liked that  	1
i came out of it feeling angry  	0
the only place good for this film is in the garbage  	0
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product	1
overall i don't think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too	0
this is infuriating	0
conclusion very filling meals	1
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service	0
the story is also both funny and poignant at times  	1
