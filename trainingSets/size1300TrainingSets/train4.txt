after charging overnight these batteries work great	1

one of the worst shows of all time  	0
here's where the movie really pied me off  	0
they will customize your order any way you'd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it	1
the service was terrible though	0
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good	1

the igo chargers and tips are really great	1
razr battery  good buy	1
i would not recommend this place	0
waitress was good though	1
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers	1
unfortunately any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script  	0
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon  	1
great atmosphere friendly and fast service	1
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode  	0
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years  	1
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back	1
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go  	1
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all  	0
overall i wasn't very impressed with noca	0
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor pizza hut coupons	0
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you	0

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard  	1
i love their fries and their beans	1
the reception has been generally good	1
very nice and relaxing late night viewing  	1
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered	1
setup went very smoothly	1
and those baby owls were adorable  	1

considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them  	0
think of the film being like a dream  	1
 down the drain because of a weak snap	0
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare	0
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try	1
don't waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film  	0
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because there's nothing lower  	0
really awful  	0
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic  	0
food quality has been horrible	0
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data	0
the phone was unusable and was not new	0
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it	0
for about 10 minutes we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon	0
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was	1
lasted one day and then blew up	0
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing  	0
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase	1
everything from acting to cinematography was solid  	1
went in for happy hour great list of wines	1
there's really nothing bad i can say about this headset	0
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first	0
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  	0
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way	1
their chow mein is so good	1
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn't receive and place calls	0

i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food	0
the selection was probably the worst i've seen in vegasthere was none	0
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note i'd love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones  	1
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing	0
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item	1
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part  	0

every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through  	0
i was very impressed with the price of the cases	1
the phone gets extremely hot	0
 in fact it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself  	1
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off  	0
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say  it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things   	0
awkward to use and unreliable	0
i didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort	0
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  	0
probably never coming back and wouldn't recommend it	0
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  	1
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional	1
i could care less the interior is just beautiful	1
the inside is really quite nice and very clean	1
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe  poor hummh  	0
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing  	0
i could care less the interior is just beautiful	1
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold  	1
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore	0
this place was such a nice surprise	1
today is the second time i've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good	1
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it	0
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order	0
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working	0
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection	1
it has all the features i want	1
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years  	1
thank you for wasting my money	0
stay away from the q	0
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing	1
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism  	1
and the sound quality is great	1
still i do like this movie for it's empowerment of women there's not enough movies out there like this one  	1
the soundtrack sucked  	0
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing  	1
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful  	0
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  	0
i like armand assante  my cable company's summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again  	1
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up  	1

he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema  	1
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time	1
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it	0
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go	1
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest  	0
the dialogue sucked  	0
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point	0
i don't have to be an accountant to know i'm getting screwed	0
see both films if you can  	1
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it	0
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen	0
so they performed	1
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions	1

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with	1
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it	0
i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive  	0
clear skype calls long battery life long range	1
then as if i hadn't wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check	0
great phone	1
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff	1
you can't relate with them hell you barely can understand them  	0

your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation  	0
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls  	1

the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated	1
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot	1

i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices	0
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good	1
the story itself is just predictable and lazy  	0
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care  	1
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad	1
the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling  	0
could not get strong enough signal	0
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie  	1
i rather enjoyed it  	1
works great	1
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach	0
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted	0
plus with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job  	1
and quite honestly often its not very good  	0
started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters  	0
the food is very good for your typical bar food	1
all i have to say is the food was amazing	1

couldn't use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas	0

disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear	0
all in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money  	0
the service was a little slow  considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace	0
a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing  	1
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch  	1
this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon	0
i still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones we just obviously don't share enough dna to copy the design over to humans	0
first of all it doesn't wear well	0
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility  	1
very disappointing  	0
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered	1
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc	1
food was average at best	0
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop  	1
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0
this if the first movie i've given a 10 to in years  	1
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place  	0
maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible	0
the camera really likes her in this movie  	1
don't do it	0
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award  	1
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way	1
works well	1
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style  	1
the kids are annoying  	0
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating  	1

hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that i've tried so far and they're all good	1
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible	0
perfect for the ps3	1

bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad  	0
my first visit to hiro was a delight	1
i probably would not go here again	0
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed	0
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place	1
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before	1
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie  	0
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here  	1
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public  	0
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south  	1
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor	0
for that it's worth checking out  	1
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak	1
but the service was beyond bad	0
i also didn't like the on button it felt like it would crack with use	0
i'm so happy to be here	1

great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting	1

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note i'd love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones  	1
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean	1
i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
waitress was a little slow in service	0

the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well	1
voice recognition is tremendous	1
worst martini ever	0
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it	0
i didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort	0
don't waste your money	0
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway	0
highly entertaining at all angles  	1
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait	0
too bad cause i know it's family owned i really wanted to like this place	0
here's where the movie really pied me off  	0
if you don't find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone	0
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  	0
yes it's that bad  	0

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use	0
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because there's nothing lower  	0
the reception is excellent	1
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0
needless to say i won't be going back anytime soon	0
the plug did not work very well	0
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor	1

real sushi lovers let's be honest  yama is not that good	0
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted  	1
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcit's all wrong  	0
 the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	1
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games	0
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great	1
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters  	1

the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative  	0
20th century fox's road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie  	0

the visual effects were awful  	0
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off  	0

it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts  	1
we are so glad we found this place	1
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1
works as described	1
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i won't be back here because it is a convenient location	0
i liked this movie way too much  	1
as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it's frightening  	1

i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk  	0

but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr  	1
it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to quality for if they did we'd have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess  	0

the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing	1

i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good	1
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good	0

hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that i've tried so far and they're all good	1
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all	0

it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura  	1
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off	0
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad  	0
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place	1
left very frustrated	0
this isn't a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment	1

funny clever hip  just like pray's previous film hype  	1

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly	0
definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness  	1
there is a brilliant twist ending  	1
but this movie is definitely a below average rent  	0
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today  	1

and none of the tones is acceptable	0
works well	1
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way  	1
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management	0

i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and i'm pretty happy with that decision	1
great value	1
i went on motorola's website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again	0
the food wasn't good	0
when i'm on this side of town this will definitely be a spot i'll hit up again	1
it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films  	0
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying	0
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone	1

after one bite i was hooked	1
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working	0
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza	1
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say  it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things   	0
his performance is simply genius  	1
good value great food great service	1
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today  	1
you could drive a semi truck into these holes  	0

the burrittos blah	0
