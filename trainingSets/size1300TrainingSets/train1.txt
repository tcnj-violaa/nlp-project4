based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i won't be going back	0

you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once	0
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly	0
the acting as you'd expect from this cast is top notch  	1

i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of	1

i found this product to be waaay too big	0
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged	0
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby	1

the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear	0
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid  	0

unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad  	0
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses	0
best breakfast buffet	1
but it is entertaining nonetheless  	1
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	0
everything about this movie is stupid  	0

but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone	1
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcit's all wrong  	0
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it	0
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0

i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that i've got it i couldn't be happier	1
i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive  	0

it kept getting worse and worse so now i'm officially done	0
good prices	1

perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera  	1

one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it  	1
it's a piece of crap	0
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them	1
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys  	0
the instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used	0

the film lacks any real scares or tension  some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least  i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself  	0
the cast is good  	1
it really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down	0
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see  	1
what a waste of time	0
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's upandcoming	1
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great	1
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review  	0
its a total package	1
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1
the case is great and works fine with the 680	1
join the club and get awesome offers via email	1
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them	1
the suspense builders were good  just cross the line from g to pg  	1
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything	0
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it	0
food was good service was good prices were good	1
it's pure brilliance  	1
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	1
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend	1
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless	0
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff	1
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away  	1
i would recommend saving room for this	1

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh  	0
it's very slow  	0

my rating just 3 out of 10  	0
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one	1
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was	1
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected	1
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does	0
setup went very smoothly	1
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
not sure who was more lost  the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out  	0
lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age  	0
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy  	0
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place	0
saggy floppy piece of junk	0
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound	1
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since	0
this phone might well be the worst i've ever had in any brand	0
unfortunately 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain  	0
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating  	1
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible	0
i would not recommend this place	0
great hands free device	1
unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening	0
i'd say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of m's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing	1
the design is very good4	1

their network coverage in los angeles is horrible	0
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film  	1
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers	1
best i've found so far  i've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using	1
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer	1
don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support	0
horrible horrible protector	0
each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious	1
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service	1
sprint charges for this service	0
very windresistant	1

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldn't eat here again	0
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water	0
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  	0
warning  stay away	0
really awful  	0
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special	1
brilliant  	1
best breakfast buffet	1
very true to shakespear and a 'must' for all shakespear fans  	1

this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced	0
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order  all yummy for my tummy	1
big disappointment with calendar sync	0
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors  	0
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film  	1
go to place for gyros	1
warning  stay away	0
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted	1
what a great double cheeseburger	1
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor  	1
i just saw this film and i recommend it  	1
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors i'd rather be using a disposable then this	0
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  	0
i as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible	0
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda  	0
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert	0
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time  	1
they are so cool	1
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job  	1
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot  	0
we will not be coming back	0
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet	0
we definately enjoyed ourselves	1
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable  	1
the ri style calamari was a joke	0
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget  	1
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i don't care how cool it looks if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless	0
the bartender was also nice	1
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it	0
the patio seating was very comfortable	1
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table	1
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression  	1
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside	1
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget  	1
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing	1
you won't regret it	1
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone	1
plus it's only 8 bucks	1
food was so gooodd	1
this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon	0
nice leather	1
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again	1
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known	0
it looks very nice	1
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers	1
i received it quickly and it works great	1
this show is made for americans  it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere  	0
they will customize your order any way you'd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it	1
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger	0
the veggitarian platter is out of this world	1
the staff are also very friendly and efficient	1
aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other debits  	0
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back	1
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  	1
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake  	0
i loved it it was really scary  	1
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only	0
the phone is sturdy and waterproof	1
don't buy this product	0
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone	1
what this film lacks is a convincing script  	0
so they performed	1
terrible product and waste of money	0
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me	1
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear	0
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character  	1
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see	1
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears	0
all the bread is made inhouse	1
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad  	0
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first	0
it's not hard to make a decent hamburger	0
this fixes all the problems	1
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end  	1
worst customer service	0
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water	0
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked	0
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you	0
i am glad i purchased it	1
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow	1
there was nothing believable about it at all  	0
the service was extremely slow	0
good show samsung	1
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them	1
horrible  don't waste your time and money	0

the manager was the worst	0
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen  	0
a film not easily forgotten  	1
this movie is so awesome  	1
the desserts were a bit strange	0
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset	0
this place has it	1
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back  	0
everything is appalling  	0
don't bother  go to the store	0
horrible  	0
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored	1
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area	1
if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance  	0
the burger had absolutely no flavor  the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor	0
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap  	0
yes it's shiny on front side  and i love it	1
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first	0
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is  	1
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount	1
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not	0
the design is very good4	1
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving  	0
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch  	1
if it were possible to give them zero stars they'd have it	0
i've bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these	0
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other  	1
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it  	1
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place	1
it was so cool  	1
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked	0
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it	1
after 20 minutes wait i got a table	0
all three broke within two months of use	0
if you act in such a film you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible  	0
as for the service i'm a fan because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks	1
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything	0
why was this film made  	0
product is exactly as described	1
last time buying from you	0
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree	1
none of it works just don't buy it	0
it really created a unique feeling though  	1
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service	1
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended	1
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie  	0
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  	0
voice recognition is tremendous	1
does not fit	0
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound	1
this place is two thumbs upway up	1

the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown	0
the igo chargers and tips are really great	1
stay away from this store be careful	0

just spicy enough perfect actually	1
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm	0
i really liked that  	1
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking	0
the shrimp tender and moist	1
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known	0
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad	0
i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive  	0
none of them are engaging or exciting  	0
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art  	1
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product	1
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action  	0
it is a really good show to watch  	1
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it  	0
will not be back	0
how can that bethe audio quality is poor	0
i got food poisoning here at the buffet	0
echo problemvery unsatisfactory	0
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table	1
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad	0
i'd rather eat airline food seriously	0
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it	0
it worked very well	1
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place	1
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews	1
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid  	0
my 810 score is mostly for the plot  	1
i love this place	1
its not user friendly	0
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil	0
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	1
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy  	0
i am very happy	1
i'm very disappointed with my decision	0
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset	0
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat	0
buyerbe very careful	0
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable	1
it was just too horrible  	0
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying  	0
do not waste your time  	0
excellent	1
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product	0
after two i felt disgusting	0
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop	0
i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull  	0

the best part about nurse betty is it's unpredictability  	1
stay away from the q	0

i do not know if this was emilio estevez's directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye  	1
beautiful styling though	1
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line  	1
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal	1

this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public  	0

this show is made for americans  it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere  	0
it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is	0
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul	1

i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe  nice ambiance clean friendly staff	1
it was forced like everything in this movie  	0
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything  	1
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance  	1
i gave it a 10  	1
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again	0
it's like a really sexy party in your mouth where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party	1
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead	1
we are sending it back	0
they also have the best cheese crisp in town	1
 the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	1
it doesn't work in europe or asia	0
he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money  	0
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere	1
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced	0

not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i'm not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer  	0
i did not expect this to be so good	1
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment  	0
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm	0
soggy and not good	0
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes	1
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving  	0
just had lunch here and had a great experience	1
and the accents are absolutely abysmal  	0
nothing at all to recommend  	0
we waited for forty five minutes in vain	0
for service i give them no stars	0
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything	1
i only used it two days and it wasn't always easy to hear with	0
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on	1
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers	0
i don't have to be an accountant to know i'm getting screwed	0
don't do it	0
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it	0
but i definitely would not eat here again	0
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed	0
once your food arrives it's meh	0
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working	0
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didn't expect more tip than that	1
it was not good	0
she's poised and amazing  	1
definitely a bargain	1
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo	1

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet	1
the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age  	1
poor voice clarity	0
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast	1
waited 2 hours  never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did	0
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone	0
best breakfast buffet	1
it isn't even an achievement as a sobadit'sgood or sobadit'smemorable movie  	0
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu	0
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed	1
this movie is bad  	0
i cannot make calls at certain places	0
just don't know why they were so slow	0
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid  	0

if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one  	1

this is an excellent film  	1
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase	1
never going back	0
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again	0
wasted two hours  	0
as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it's frightening  	1
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them	0
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean	1
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully	1
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face	0
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good  	1
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family	1
think of the film being like a dream  	1
regardless the film fails on most levels  	0

perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this	0
plan on ordering from them again and again	1
the shrimp tender and moist	1
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery	0

this movie is so awesome  	1
it is worth the drive	1
you won't regret it	1

the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few  	1
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger	0
there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit  	0
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat	1
woa talk about awful  	0
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed  	0
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data	0
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently	0
a fly was in my apple juice a fly	0
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude	0

you won't regret it	1
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen	1
the dialogue sucked  	0
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best	0
i don't think you will be disappointed  	1
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently	0
buyerbe very careful	0

however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons	0
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there	1
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine	1
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i won't be going back	0
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means	0

all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast  	1
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger	0
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers  	1
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma	1
it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work  	1
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it  	1
i paid too much  	0
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	1

good item low price	1
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion  	1
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did	1
there is no plot or storyline  	0
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	0
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end	1
i paid too much  	0
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before	1
