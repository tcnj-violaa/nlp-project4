it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon	0
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful	1
this one just fails to create any real suspense  	0
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great	1
it's a piece of crap	0
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint	0

it doesn't make you look cool	0
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc	1

i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season  	0
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up  	1
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts	1
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i	1
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas	0

they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with  	1
this place is amazing	1
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations it's an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience  	1
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well	1
camerawork  again bad  	0
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating  	1

the directing seems too pretentious  	0
i would not recommend this place	0

i didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes  	1
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene  	0
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late	0
this show is made for americans  it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere  	0
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look	0
you can watch them preparing the delicious food	1
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up	1
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm	1
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards  	0

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief  	0
i paid too much  	0
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas	1
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract  	1
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source	1
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable	1
it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films  	0

very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist  	0
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20  left in the morning	0
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense  	0
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
this is definitely one of the bad ones  	0
everything about this movie is stupid  	0
gets a signal when other verizon phones won't	1
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film  	1
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered	0
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap  	0
he was terrible	0
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well	0
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed	1

as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	1
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
magical help	1
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one	1
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast	1
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast  	0

also the area where my unit broke i'm not too fond of the magnetic strap	0

nice design and quality	1
later i found myself lost in the power of the film  	1
one of my favorite purchases ever	1

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
it was horrendous  	0
the management is rude	0
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap  	0

i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  	1
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot	1
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was  	1
very friendly staff	1

seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh	0
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles	1
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film  	1
everything from acting to cinematography was solid  	1
as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it's frightening  	1
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back  	0
my fianc√© and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away	1
the staff are also very friendly and efficient	1
i wouldn't recommend buying this product	0

lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers	1
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree	1
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor pizza hut coupons	0
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times  	0
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing  	0
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly	0
the instruction manual is lacking	0

crostini that came with the salad was stale	0
food arrived quickly	1
i probably would not go here again	0
the pleather case doesn't fit	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating	0
i've missed numerous calls because of this reason	0
for that it's worth checking out  	1
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up	0
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree	1
service sucks	0
seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on  	0
brilliance indeed  	1
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree	1
the story itself is just predictable and lazy  	0
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing	0
my girlfriend's veal was very bad	0
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes  	0
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film  	1
it's been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation	1
poorly contstruct hinge	0
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat	1
delicious and i will absolutely be back	1
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only	0
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene  	1
greatno problems at all	1
as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it's frightening  	1
i will not be eating there again	0
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one	0
definitely worth checking out  	1
very prompt service	1
this isn't a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment	1
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake	0
it is a very well acted and done tv movie  	1
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable	1
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  	0
as many people complained i found this headset's microphone was very weak	0
great pizza and salads	1
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this  bad idea we both hated it  	0
would not reccommend	0
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent  	1
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script  	0
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script  	1
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside	1
 a happy wonderful feel good ending  	1
i could not recommend these more	0
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked	0
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive	1
disappointed	0
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad  	0
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1
def coming back to bowl next time	1
exactly what i wanted	1
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public  	0
lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly won't allow  	0
it is a very well acted and done tv movie  	1
sooooo good	1
the only thing i wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as i don't like it pur√©ed	0
i don't each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here	1
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere	0
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again	1
i wouldnt see this movie again for free  	0
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before  	1
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixar's cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories  	1
don't make the same mistake that i did and please don't buy this phone	0
save your money i've had this item for 11 months now	0
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art  	1
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles  	1
those phones are working just fine now	1
very good stuff for the price	1
my friend loved the salmon tartar	1
they also have the best cheese crisp in town	1
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating	0
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one	0
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release  	0
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant	1
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food	0
as many people complained i found this headset's microphone was very weak	0
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script  	1
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better	1
the concert sequences just sucked  	0
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all	0
great product	1
i did not expect this to be so good	1
actually the graphics were good at the time  	1
good case	1
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high	1
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone	1
it didn't charge for me	0
after one bite i was hooked	1
we are sending it back	0
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film  	1
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me	1
unfortunately it did not work	0
you won't forget this movie  	1
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film  	0
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had	1
my colleague  i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great	1
it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is	0
the reception has been generally good	1
the cast is always entertaining as usual  	1
the instruction manual is lacking	0
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone	1
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr  	1
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  	0
 comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously	1
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	1
it's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage  	0
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed	0
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush it's amazing what they do with eggplant	1
i love this place	1
you can't beat the price on these	1
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it	0
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died	0
i found the product to be easy to set up and use	1
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone	0
it's a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver  	1
as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening  	0
so don't go there if you are looking for good food	0
provides good protection and looks classy too	1
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isn't it	0
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen  	0
their steaks are 100 recommended	1
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here  	0
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item	1
four stars for the food  the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe  still letting us in to eat 	1
the phone is sturdy and waterproof	1
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop	0
there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible  	0
awful service	0
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent	1
awsome device works great	1
setup went very smoothly	1
that one didn't work either	0
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased	1
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief  	0
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost  	1
it's been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation	1
never got it	0
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it	0
horrible horrible protector	0
i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk  	0
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional	1
what a waste of time	0
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point	0
buyerbe very careful	0
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars	0
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great	1
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike  	1
the story is also both funny and poignant at times  	1
friend's pasta  also bad he barely touched it	0
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost  	1
cant say enough good things about this place	1
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed	0
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for	0
great headset very impressed  h500	1
i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking  	1
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked	0
went for lunch  service was slow	0
 in fact it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself  	1
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were  	0
food was below average	0
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible	1
this battery is an excellent bargain	1
i hate movies like that  	0
i don't think i'll be running back to carly's anytime soon for food	0
worst customer service ever	0
i was not happy with this item	0
dessert panna cotta was amazing	1
i gave it 5 stars then and i'm giving it 5 stars now	1
it's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage  	0
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying	0
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything i've tried gets my seal of approval	1
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money	1
it's too bad the food is so damn generic	0
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery	1
it will drive you barking mad  	0
the macarons here are insanely good	1
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver	1
conclusion very filling meals	1
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days	1
i never come again	0
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table	0
 don't waste your time  	0
just don't know why they were so slow	0
the waitress and manager are so friendly	1
and finally after all that we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell  	0
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside	1
it was so boring  	0
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore	0
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see	0
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script  	1
mediocre food	0
all i have to say is the food was amazing	1
terrible management	0
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
both do good jobs and are quite amusing  	1
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it  	1
earbud piece breaks easily	0
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens	0
i didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me	0
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great	1
does everything it should and more	1
very disappointing	0
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service	1
the acting as you'd expect from this cast is top notch  	1
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh  	0
the desserts were a bit strange	0
the only thing i wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as i don't like it pur√©ed	0
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast  	1
do not buy do not buyit sucks	0
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful	1
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio  so very delightful	1
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	0
everything was fresh and delicious	1
would recommend this item	1
sending it back	0
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me	0
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous	0
that was funny  	1
delete this film from your mind  	0
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity  	0
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  	0
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character  	1
if you're not familiar check it out	1
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive	1
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone	0
total waste of time	0
excellent	1
the accompanied software is almost brilliant	1
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning  	0
i highly recommend this case	1
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap	0
for service i give them no stars	0
we won't be going back	0
still i do like this movie for it's empowerment of women there's not enough movies out there like this one  	1
it's a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this  	0
the phone is sturdy and waterproof	1
great pizza and salads	1
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh	0
these are the nicest restaurant owners i've ever come across	1
very pleased with this headset	1
the service was terrible food was mediocre	0
excellent starter wireless headset	0
i only used it two days and it wasn't always easy to hear with	0
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists  	1
i don't each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here	1
i'm glad this pretentious piece of s didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec  	0
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but i'm not inspired to go back	0
don't make the same mistake that i did and please don't buy this phone	0
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award  	1
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu	1
excellent product for the price	1
highly recommended	1
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table	1
same evening him and i are both drastically sick	0
excellent sound quality	1
we won't be going back	0
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible	1
better than expected	1
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended	1
i love their fries and their beans	1
10 out of 10 stars  	1
works as described	1
a great touch	1
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before	1
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat	0
food was below average	0
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly	0
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree	1
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star  	1
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too	0
my headset works just peachykeen	1
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film  	1
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems	0
the film lacks any real scares or tension  some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least  i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself  	0
i don't think i'll be running back to carly's anytime soon for food	0
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  	0
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden	0
it is a really good show to watch  	1
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear	0
none of it works just don't buy it	0
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees	0
needless to say i won't be going back anytime soon	0
sweetest phone	1
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night  highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 	1
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost  	1
i would not recommend this item to anyone	0
i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone  	0
i wouldn't recommend buying this product	0
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well	1
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen  	1
i've missed numerous calls because of this reason	0
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid	1
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script  	0
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is  	0
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus	1
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea	0
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while	1
the instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used	0
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic  	1
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage  	1
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action  	0
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today  	1
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  	0
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful	1
poor quality	0
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined	0
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back  	0
everything was perfect the night we were in	1
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  	0
sprint charges for this service	0
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles	1
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad  	0
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far	1
there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit  	0
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night  	1
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference  	1
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back  	0
i also had to taste my mom's multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious	1
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and i'm very happy with my purchase	1
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder	1
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated	1
items stated as included from the description are not included	0
horrible horrible protector	0
the service was terrible though	0
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way  	1
i was very disappointed	0
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable	1
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget  	1
maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible	0
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus	1
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends  	1
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working	0
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene  	0
this device is great in several situations1	1
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games	0
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use	1
i liked this movie way too much  	1
if you look for authentic thai food go else where	0
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product	0

but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then i'm lost	0
we'd definitely go back here again	1
i didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort	0
however i needed some better instructions	0
its not user friendly	0
we'd definitely go back here again	1
battery is holding up well	1
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great	1
ambience is perfect	1
you won't regret it	1
it was so boring  	0
but this movie really got to me  	1
actually the graphics were good at the time  	1
none of them are engaging or exciting  	0
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here  	0
absolutel junk	0
warning  do not buy	0
great pocket pc  phone combination	1
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit	1
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  	0
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art  	1
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off	0
his costars don't fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted  	0
the warm beer didn't help	0
the phone was unusable and was not new	0

if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
if someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart	0
i'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place	0
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i don't want to waste time on bad reviewing i'll leave it at that	0
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas	1
as i said abovepretty useless	0
excellent product for the price	1
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected	1
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here  	1
couldn't use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas	0
it was so funny  	1
nice case feels good in your hands	1
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them	1
performed awful  muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call	0
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only	0
my 810 score is mostly for the plot  	1
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu	0
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip	1
excellent product	1
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap	0
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver	1
great phone	1
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair	0
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch  	1
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	0
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back  	0
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good  	1
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that	0
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best	0
but this movie really got to me  	1
what a waste of time	0
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans  	1
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle  	1
the best phone in market 	1
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either	0
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film  	1
overall i was not impressed and would not go back	0
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone	0
i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk  	0
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch  	1
it is a very well acted and done tv movie  	1
a truly truly bad film  	0
just don't know why they were so slow	0
cant get the software to work with my computer	0
you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie  but you do wish for just a small sample to savor  	1
doesn't last long	0
omg the food was delicioso	1
none of them are engaging or exciting  	0
this movie is terrible  	0
i probably won't be back to be honest	0
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face	0
then there's the plot holes  	0
good case	1
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago  	1
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner	1
 really really good rice all the time	1
the service was a little slow  considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace	0
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
i highly recommend this case	1
i'll give this film 10 out of 10  	1
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  	0
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr  	1
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly	0
it's a great place and i highly recommend it	1
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten	1
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens	0
its a total package	1
so bad  	0
as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening  	0
food was really boring	0
needless to say i wasted my money	0
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles	1
