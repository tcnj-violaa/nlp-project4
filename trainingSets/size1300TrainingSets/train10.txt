it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles	1
the ambiance was incredible	1
i did not expect this to be so good	1
i probably won't be back to be honest	0

the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint	0

the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate  	1
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way	0
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately	0
as for the service i'm a fan because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks	1
very pleased with this headset	1
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film  	1
i can't believe there's even a sequel to this  	0
jabra ear gels r the best	1
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  	1
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries i've ever had	0

logitech bluetooth headset is a 10	1
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles  	1

the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated	0
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way	0
not enough volume	0
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid  	0
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in	0
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar	0

the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had	1
very good stuff for the price	1
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes	1
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay	1
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming	1
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair	0
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas	0
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car	1
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor  	1
the script iswas there a script  	0
i'm so happy to be here	1
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely  	0
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked	0
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it  	0
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper	1
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white lowbudget original  	1
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  	0
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect	1
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest  	0
we loved the place	1
i literally vomited while watching this film  	0
food was below average	0
we were promptly greeted and seated	1
i highly recommend this case	1

if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one  	1
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door	0
it has all the features i want	1
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  	1
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated	1
i started this review with two stars but i'm editing it to give it only one	0
the dialogue sucked  	0
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold	0
battery has no life	0
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install	0
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more	0
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy  	1
if you want a real scare rent this one  	1
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism  	1
 a happy wonderful feel good ending  	1
i liked it  	1
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings	0
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews	1
don't waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film  	0
even worse than ticker  	0

fantastic food	1
the battery works great	1
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise	0
i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk  	0
the accompanied software is almost brilliant	1
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today	0
setup couldn't have been simpler	1
it's pure brilliance  	1
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see	0
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
the film lacks any real scares or tension  some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least  i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself  	0
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic  	1
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture  	1
nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes  	0
this show is made for americans  it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere  	0
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish	0
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer	1
 and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away  	0
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back	1
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was  how it contained holes inconsistencies and  frankly  a whole lot of crap  and how horrid the dancing was  	0
this place was such a nice surprise	1
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger	0
worst foodservice i've had in a while	0
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it  	1
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty  	0
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script  	1
you can't beat the price on these	1
my colleague  i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great	1
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste	0
another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model	0
there is no plot or storyline  	0
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems	1
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery	0
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these  	0
great phone	1
we won't be going back	0
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace  	0
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad	0
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc	1
 with great sound effects and impressive special effects i can't recommend this movie enough  	1
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic  	0
this is not moviemaking  	0
audio quality is poor very poor	0
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr	0
still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow  	1
i thought it was bad  	0
unreliable  i'm giving up	0
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  	0
very clear quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset	1
it was a waste of my money	0
i'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place	0
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow	1
really bad  	0
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life  	0
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad  	0
there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit  	0
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza	1
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty	1
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one	1
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
the script is a big flawed mess  	0
simple lightweight and great fit	1
boy was that sucker dry	0
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end	1
fantastic food	1
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros	0
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic  	0
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to	1
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car	1
if you haven't gone here go now	1
don't waste your time here	0
eclectic selection	1
everything from acting to cinematography was solid  	1
it's a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect  	1
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery	0
the kids are annoying  	0
don't be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010  	1
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor	0
started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters  	0
terrible product and waste of money	0
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me  	0
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr	0
this is a great deal	1
excellent starter wireless headset	0
regardless the film fails on most levels  	0
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film  	1
i don't have to be an accountant to know i'm getting screwed	0
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced	0
really awful  	0
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop	0
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product	0
the block was amazing	1
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar	0
first of all it doesn't wear well	0
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product	0
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0
very unreliable service from tmobile 	0
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity  	0
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland	0
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
very friendly staff	1
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch	0
waitress was sweet and funny	1
very bad experience	0
the poor actors  	0
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia	1
how can that bethe audio quality is poor	0
it's pure brilliance  	1
fans of the genre will be in heaven  	1
please dont waste your money	0
very bad experience	0
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible	1
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show  	0
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm	1
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time  	0
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it	0
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing  	0
the reception is excellent	1
nothing special	0
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor  	1
give this one a look  	1
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was  how it contained holes inconsistencies and  frankly  a whole lot of crap  and how horrid the dancing was  	0
i own 2 of these cases and would order another	1
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen	0
the waitresses are very friendly	1
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i'm not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer  	0
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed	0
couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal	1
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with  	1
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12	0
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this  bad idea we both hated it  	0
i cannot make calls at certain places	0
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style  	1
penne vodka excellent	1
i don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving	0
but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn  	0
a pretty good product	1
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game  	1
avoid this one if you can	0
you can find better movies at youtube  	0
delicious and i will absolutely be back	1
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater	0
will not be back	0
great charger	1
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style	0
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there  	1
the veggitarian platter is out of this world	1
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made  	1
this game rocks  	1
nothing special	0
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten	0
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while	1
talk about great customer service of course we will be back	1
friend's pasta  also bad he barely touched it	0
maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible	0
mobile phone tools are a must have	1
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear	0
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this  	0
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it  	1
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	1
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days	1
earbud piece breaks easily	0
it was a great phone	1
works as described	1
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous	1
 a happy wonderful feel good ending  	1
restored my phone to like new performance	1
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company	0
i didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes  	1
also it's a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse  	1
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside	1
they know how to make them here	1
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	0
the story is also both funny and poignant at times  	1
ambience is perfect	1
it shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs	0
i still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones we just obviously don't share enough dna to copy the design over to humans	0
the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling  	0
waiter was a jerk	0
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone	0
weird vibe from owners	0
this is a beautiful phone	1
still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow  	1
don't waste your money and time	0
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight	1
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal	1
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee	0
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it	1
ryan's bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i won't be revisiting	0
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer	0
what a waste of time	0
being a 90's child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons  	1
i'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have  	1
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it	1
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up  	0
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone	0
i recently tried caballero's and i have been back every week since	1
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you won't be disappointed	1
fast service	1
it was pretty gross	0
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isn't it	0
i would not recommend this item to anyone	0
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing	0
the sides are delish  mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn  beateous	1
hitchcock is a great director  	1
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again	0
not my thing	0
i like armand assante  my cable company's summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again  	1
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset	0
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia	1
good food  good service 	1
i have recommended it to friends  	1
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart  	1
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere	1
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list	0
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well	1
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold	0
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not	0
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days	0
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off	0
great software for motorolas	1
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity  	0
its not user friendly	0
it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason  	0
very satisifed with that	1
cant say enough good things about this place	1
lame would be the best way to describe it  	0
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking	0
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking  	0
i started this review with two stars but i'm editing it to give it only one	0
2 thumbs up to this seller	1
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad  	0
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable  	1
there is a brilliant twist ending  	1
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasn't great	0
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm	0
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today	0
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom  	0
i am sorry i made this purchase	0
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish	1
i would recommend this	1
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic  	0
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud	1
very good product well made	1
my sister has one also and she loves it	1
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced	0
everything was perfect the night we were in	1
i am more than happy with this product	1
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor  	1
5 stars for the brick oven bread app	1
great headset very impressed  h500	1
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age  	1
great brunch spot	1
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen	0
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible	0
i went to bachi burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed	1
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked	0
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear	0
love this product	1
nice docking station for home or work	1
the budget was evidently very limited  	0
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this	0
i'm not really sure how joey's was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine	0
after 20 minutes wait i got a table	0
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data	0
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off	0
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's  	1
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	0
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  	0
good food  good service 	1
a great touch	1
