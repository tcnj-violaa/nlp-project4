the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see  	1
the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling  	0
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
waste of money	0
exactly what i wanted	1
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay	1
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience	1

but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr  	1
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0

absolutel junk	0
the least said about the acting the better  	0
awful  	0
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying  	0
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution	0
i'll even say it again  this is torture  	0
it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is	0
great food	1
a truly truly bad film  	0
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him  	1

spend your money elsewhere	0
why was this film made  	0
all in all i think it was a good investment	1
i did not expect this to be so good	1
the real disappointment was our waiter	0
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place	1
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in	0
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone	0
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time i'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago	1

i have recommended it to friends  	1
the acting is beyond abysmal  	0
very good stuff for the price	1
i enjoyed it  	1
very much disappointed with this company	0
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop  	1
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste	0
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time	1
not too screamy not to masculine but just right  	1

good product good seller	1
don't waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film  	0
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me	1
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed  	0
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film  	1
they were excellent	1
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans  	1
third the cheese on my friend's burger was cold	0
there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible  	0
i'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place	0
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	0
food was so gooodd	1
it was just too horrible  	0
both great	1
if you look for authentic thai food go else where	0
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery	0

i wear it everyday and it holds up very well	1
don't waste your money	0

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1
those phones are working just fine now	1
doesn't hold charge	0
they have great dinners	1
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious	1
poor product	0
soggy and not good	0
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth  	1
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature	1
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill  	1
the kids are very cool too  	1
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player	0
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i'm not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer  	0
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt  	1
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking	0
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	1
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality	1
better than you'd expect	1
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love  	1
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it	0
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea	0
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film  	1
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public  	0
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see	0
all in all i think it was a good investment	1
the warm beer didn't help	0
definitely a bargain	1
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense  	0
plan on ordering from them again and again	1

the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous	1
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320	0
audio quality is poor very poor	0

i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features  	1
couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal	1
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like they're 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc  	0
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure  	0
mic doesn't work	0
i own 2 of these cases and would order another	1
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  	1
these are the nicest restaurant owners i've ever come across	1
funny clever hip  just like pray's previous film hype  	1
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again  	1
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution	0
oh the charger seems to work fine	1
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning  	0
gets the job done	1
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave  	1
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when i'm not wearing it	0
absolutel junk	0
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty  	0
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short	0
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it	1
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent	1
the reception is excellent	1
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well	0
better than new	1
phenomenal food service and ambiance	1
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense  	0
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low	0
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again	1
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased	1
terrible my car will not accept this cassette	0
it was awesome	1
it definitely was not as good as my s11	1
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious	1
this movie is also revealing  	1
and finally after all that we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell  	0
portable and it works	1
it shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs	0
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen  	0
i probably would not go here again	0
this is actually a very smart movie  	1
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others  	1
very comfortable	1
you can't relate with them hell you barely can understand them  	0
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree	1
horrible phone	0
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk	0
only pros  large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough	1
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service	0
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  	0
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service	1
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore	0
never had anything to complain about here	1
this isn't a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment	1
i've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it	1
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic  a real treat	1
i don't think i've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much  	0
the burrittos blah	0
it's pretty easy	1
we'd definitely go back here again	1
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price	1
best headset ever	1
voice quality signal strength dropped calls	0
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once	0
hitchcock is a great director  	1
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone	0
sooooo good	1
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly	1
excellently produced by one of scifi's best producers scot vandiver   	1
the cast is always entertaining as usual  	1
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  	0
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much  	0
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery  	0
food was good service was good prices were good	1
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying	0
very dissapointing performance	0
don't waste your money and time	0
couldn't figure it out	0
nice solid keyboard	1
i don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt	0

it will drive you barking mad  	0
this place was such a nice surprise	1
