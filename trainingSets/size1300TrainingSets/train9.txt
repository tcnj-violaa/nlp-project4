the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see  	1
the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling  	0
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1

but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr  	1
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0

why was this film made  	0
all in all i think it was a good investment	1
i did not expect this to be so good	1
the real disappointment was our waiter	0
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place	1
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in	0
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone	0

very good stuff for the price	1

not too screamy not to masculine but just right  	1

steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film  	1
they were excellent	1
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans  	1
third the cheese on my friend's burger was cold	0
there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible  	0
i'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place	0

they have great dinners	1
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious	1
poor product	0
soggy and not good	0
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth  	1
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature	1
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill  	1
the kids are very cool too  	1
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player	0
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i'm not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer  	0
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt  	1
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking	0
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	1
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality	1
better than you'd expect	1
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love  	1
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it	0
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea	0

couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal	1
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like they're 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc  	0
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure  	0
mic doesn't work	0
i own 2 of these cases and would order another	1
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  	1
these are the nicest restaurant owners i've ever come across	1
funny clever hip  just like pray's previous film hype  	1
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again  	1
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution	0
oh the charger seems to work fine	1
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning  	0
gets the job done	1
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave  	1
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when i'm not wearing it	0
absolutel junk	0
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty  	0
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short	0

it definitely was not as good as my s11	1
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious	1

and finally after all that we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell  	0
portable and it works	1
it shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs	0
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen  	0
i probably would not go here again	0
this is actually a very smart movie  	1

the cast is always entertaining as usual  	1
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  	0
