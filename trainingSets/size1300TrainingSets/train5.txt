i was very disappointed in the movie  	0
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this  	0
they do not care about the consumer one bit	0

it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
the battery runs down quickly	0
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad  	0
his performance is simply genius  	1
it's very slow  	0
the worst was the salmon sashimi	0

brilliant  	1
once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place	1
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm	1

it worked very well	1
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with	0
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent	1
buy a different phone  but not this	0
must have been an off night at this place	0
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism  	1
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn  	1
the food is very good for your typical bar food	1
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating	0
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  	1
does not work	0
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed	0
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side	0
but it is entertaining nonetheless  	1
first of all it doesn't wear well	0
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways	1
5 stars for the brick oven bread app	1
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked	0
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him  	1
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices	1
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed  	1
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted  	1
it's not what it says it is	0

con spotty service	0

yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design	0
and finally after all that we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell  	0
i just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine	0
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcit's all wrong  	0
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in	0
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good	1
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood	1
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either	0
the best phone in market 	1
dee snider just plain sucks  	0
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting	1

both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract  	1
i connected my wife's bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case	1
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts	1
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle	1
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars	0
food was so gooodd	1
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse	0
did not like at all	0
i'm glad this pretentious piece of s didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of québec  	0
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game  	1
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad	0
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes  	0
very satisifed with that	1
this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon	0
not too screamy not to masculine but just right  	1
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative  	0
awful service	0
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying	0
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  	1
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here  	0
avoid this film at all costs  	0
good audio quality	1
first of all it doesn't wear well	0
all in all i think it was a good investment	1
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying	0
he's a national treasure  	1

hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood  	1
a standout scene  	1
i dressed up to be treated so rudely	0
mobile phone tools are a must have	1
as for the service i'm a fan because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks	1
they dropped more than the ball	0
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had	1
i will not return	0
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot	1
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee	0
this is an unbelievable bargain	1
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately	0
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot  	0
none of them are engaging or exciting  	0
the staff are great the ambiance is great	1
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good	0
i've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear	0
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry	0
i wouldn't recommend buying this product	0
last time buying from you	0
the instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used	0
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good  	0
i mean this in a terrible way  	0
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  	0
later i found myself lost in the power of the film  	1
one of my favorite purchases ever	1
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family	1
i really liked that  	1
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear	0
soggy and not good	0
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no	0
what i really like there is the crepe station	1
i'm super pissd	0
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it  	1
great charger	1
an excellent performance from ms  	1
i wouldn't recommend buying this product	0
the battery is completely useless to me	0
hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood  	1
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0
works well	1
it was forced like everything in this movie  	0
we waited for forty five minutes in vain	0
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film  	1
the pleather case doesn't fit	0
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser	1
we will not be coming back	0
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one	0
went in for happy hour great list of wines	1
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad	0
overall i was not impressed and would not go back	0
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch  	1
it's the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher it's meanings  	1
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction  	0
it's an empty hollow shell of a movie  	0
if the food isn't bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world's worstannoying drunk people	0
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers  	1
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was  	1
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated	0
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless	0
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa  	1
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution	0
worthless product	0
i believe that pitch black was done well  	1
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold	0
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had	1
this one just fails to create any real suspense  	0
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film  	1
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing	0
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films  	1
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well	0
what a great double cheeseburger	1
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us	0
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table	0
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot	1
that's a huge design flaw unless i'm not using it correctly which i don't think is the case	0
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered	0
this is not moviemaking  	0
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house	0
i'm still infatuated with this phone	1
very slow at seating even with reservation	0
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all	0
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily	0
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips	1
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great	1
i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking  	1
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off	0
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset	0
i'd like to return it	0
he deserves 5 stars	1
great phone	1
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there  letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him  	1
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger	0
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible	1
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again  	1
this isn't a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment	1
it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work  	1
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter	1
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera  	1
oh the charger seems to work fine	1
don't waste your time here	0
never going back	0
probably not in a hurry to go back	0
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	1

the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint	0
great atmosphere friendly and fast service	1
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  	0
not too screamy not to masculine but just right  	1
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and that's right  	1
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me	0
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	0
the visual effects were awful  	0
i rather enjoyed it  	1
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold	0
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget  	1
the kids are annoying  	0
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate	0
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced	0
my sister has one also and she loves it	1
their steaks are 100 recommended	1
it's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound  	1
the lighting is awful  	0
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to	1
crust is not good	0
does not work	0
i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasn't high priced	1
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it	1
but even the talented carrell can't save this  	0
ordered a double cheeseburger  got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks	0
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying	0
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something	1
waste your money on this game  	1
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i don't want to waste time on bad reviewing i'll leave it at that	0
that's a huge design flaw unless i'm not using it correctly which i don't think is the case	0
none of them are engaging or exciting  	0
the service was outshining  i definitely recommend the halibut	1
our server was super nice and checked on us many times	1
it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to quality for if they did we'd have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess  	0
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible	0
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if you're looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further  	1
gets a signal when other verizon phones won't	1
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor  	1
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value	1
this is a disgrace	0
i recently tried caballero's and i have been back every week since	1
best headset ever	1
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care	1
this is just a great movie  	1
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic  	1
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them	0
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems	0
the soundtrack wasn't terrible either  	1
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably  	0
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didn't overwhelm the soup	1
uncomfortable in the ear don't use with lg vx9900 env	0
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	0
there is nothing authentic about this place	0

i would have given no star if i was able	0
 really really good rice all the time	1
very clear quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset	1
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  	0
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts	0
but it picked up speed and got right to the point  	1
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk	0
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order	0
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	1
it's just lame  	0
i advise you to look out for it  	1
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset	0
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema  	1
everything was fresh and delicious	1
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot  	0
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho	0
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list	0

my girlfriend's veal was very bad	0
just don't know why they were so slow	0
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things	0
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left	0
gets the job done	1
i love this device	1
i'm pleased	1

the management is rude	0
it quit working after i'd used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset i've ever owned	1
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious	1
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film  	1
good product good seller	1
i went to bachi burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed	1
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative	1
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time i'm in vegas	1
think of the film being like a dream  	1
when i'm on this side of town this will definitely be a spot i'll hit up again	1
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic  	0
this game rocks  	1
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden	0
on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  	0
it's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg	0
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting	1
the service was a little slow  considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace	0
really good product	1
overall i wasn't very impressed with noca	0
not sure who was more lost  the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out  	0
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	1
perfect for the ps3	1
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product	1
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
 down the drain because of a weak snap	0
too bad you have to pay up to  a month for the service	0
the only place good for this film is in the garbage  	0
yeah the movie pretty much sucked  	0
i didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort	0
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder  	0
the fried rice was dry as well	0
reasonably priced also	1
great value	1
and the drinks are weak people	0
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean	1
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value	1
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool	1
not my thing	0
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip	1
very clear quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset	1
third the cheese on my friend's burger was cold	0
it's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage  	0
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere	0
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect	0
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything  	1
the film looks cheap and bland  	0
now this is a movie i really dislike  	0
it was forced like everything in this movie  	0
not good enough for the price	0
the selection was probably the worst i've seen in vegasthere was none	0
not enough volume	0
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone	0
the script is a big flawed mess  	0
love this headset	1
doesn't work	0
i would recommend this	1
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job  	1
you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie  but you do wish for just a small sample to savor  	1
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it  	1
you can't beat the price on these	1
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher  	1
it was also the right balance of war and love  	1
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it	1
very good product well made	1
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again  	1
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount	1
my phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand	1
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  	0
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio  so very delightful	1
the instruction manual is lacking	0
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old  	1
if you're not familiar check it out	1

plantronics bluetooth excelent buy	1
very friendly staff	1
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's  	1
great for the jawbone	1
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed	0
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art  	1
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop  	1
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul	1
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever  	1
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen	1
it even has its sweet moments  	1
dee snider just plain sucks  	0
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  	1
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing	1
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing	1
not even good for camp value  	0
then as if i hadn't wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check	0
plug was the wrong size	0
excellent bluetooth headset	1
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off	0
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem	0
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone	1
i do not know if this was emilio estevez's directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye  	1
overall i wasn't very impressed with noca	0
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit	1
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	0
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if you're looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further  	1
food was really good and i got full petty fast	1
this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon	0
the plug did not work very well	0
very poor service	0
my phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand	1
gets a signal when other verizon phones won't	1

poor product	0
the desserts were a bit strange	0
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier	1
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff	1

highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad	1
works well	1
rating 1 out of 10  	0
doesn't hold charge	0
made very sturdy	1
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  	1
it was too predictable even for a chick flick  	0
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family  	1
i don't know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories  	1
our server was super nice and checked on us many times	1
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good	1
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service	1
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesn't know how to pace his films  	0
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it  	1
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here  	1
rude  inconsiderate management	0
the macarons here are insanely good	1
it shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs	0
great brunch spot	1

dee snider just plain sucks  	0
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable	1
it also had a new problem	0
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasn't great	0
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it  	1
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception	1
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child  	1
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table	1
as for the service i'm a fan because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks	1
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see	1
none of it works just don't buy it	0

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review  	0
thoroughly disappointed	0
i connected my wife's bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case	1
everything is appalling  	0
hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood  	1
protects the phone on all sides	1
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm	1
it didn't charge for me	0
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down	0
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
he really didn't seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests  	0
later i found myself lost in the power of the film  	1
i'm glad this pretentious piece of s didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of québec  	0
i love this device	1
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions	1
lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly won't allow  	0
a bit predictable  	0
too bad you have to pay up to  a month for the service	0
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow	1
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like they're 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc  	0
 don't waste your time  	0
this fixes all the problems	1
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic  a real treat	1
the lighting is awful  	0
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible	1
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger	0
omelets are to die for	1
it was packed	0
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style  	1
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  	1
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works  	1
the food is very good for your typical bar food	1
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well	0
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts	0
you won't forget this movie  	1
it was just too horrible  	0
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference  	1
i received it quickly and it works great	1
what a waste of time	0
it's really easy	1
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside	1

it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however it's not	1
service was fantastic	1
there is no plot or storyline  	0
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means	0
always a pleasure dealing with him	1
this place deserves no stars	0
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking  	0
in short don't bother with this movie  	0
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me  	1
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid  	0
the desserts were a bit strange	0
very good quality though	1
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area	1
camerawork  again bad  	0
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie  	0
see both films if you can  	1
 but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies  	0
i could barely stomach the meal but didn't complain because it was a business lunch	0
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia	1
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing  	0
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor	1
it is zillion times away from reality  	0
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all	0
it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is	0
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love	1
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it	1
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it	0
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers  	1
and finally after all that we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell  	0
the battery life is highly unacceptable	0
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue  	1
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery  	0
there's really nothing bad i can say about this headset	0
good quality	1
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food	0
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was	1
defective crap	0
then the film just dropped the ball  	0
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had	1
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful  	0
it's just painful  	0
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic  a real treat	1
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place	1
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom  	0
it has been a winner for us	1
third the cheese on my friend's burger was cold	0
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  	0
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars	0
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet	0
im in az all the time and now have my new spot	1
best tacos in town by far	1
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again  	1
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  	1
piece of trash	0

excellent service	1

this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it  	1
pretty awesome place	1
really ugly	0
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it	0
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phone's autoanswer	1
weird vibe from owners	0
one of my favorite purchases ever	1
everything was fresh and delicious	1
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent	1
the inside is really quite nice and very clean	1
definitely worth checking out  	1
crisp and clear	1
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last	0
save your money i've had this item for 11 months now	0
it's an empty hollow shell of a movie  	0
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid  	0
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it  	1
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff	1
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding  	0
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat	1
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone	0
if you're not familiar check it out	1
i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull  	0
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last	0
if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice  	1
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff	1
the desserts were a bit strange	0
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly	1
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next  	1
it is a really good show to watch  	1
the food was terrible	0
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing	0
i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk  	0
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item	1
the bt headset was such a disapoinment	0
a great touch	1
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only	0
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night  highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 	1
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable	1
i was very disappointed in the movie  	0
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race  	1
about half way through this film i started to dislike it  	0
the only thing i wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as i don't like it puréed	0
its the best headset i have used	1
the design is very good4	1
this is a great deal	1
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent	1
it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work  	1
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me  	0
the lighting is awful  	0
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again  	1
i also didn't like the on button it felt like it would crack with use	0
even worse than ticker  	0
it was a waste of my money	0
good value works fine  power via usb car or wall outlet	1
i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there  	0
we've tried to like this place but after 10 times i think we're done with them	0
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale	0
unfortunately 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain  	0
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger	0
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  	1
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great	0
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn't receive and place calls	0
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone  	0
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset	0
i usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight  doesn't mess up my hair	1
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative	1
this place should honestly be blown up	0
hands down my favorite italian restaurant	1
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted  	0
the patio seating was very comfortable	1
will order from them again	1
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	1
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew  	0
we'd definitely go back here again	1
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying	0
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices	0
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm	1
is pretty funny  	1
my phone sounded ok  not great  ok but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldn't understand a word being said on it	0
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
the battery runs down quickly	0
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done  	0
we'd definitely go back here again	1
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company	0
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  	1
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh	1
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two	0
the block was amazing	1
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	1
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best	0
i will come back here every time i'm in vegas	1
no i'm going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it	0
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie  	0
was not happy	0
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time i'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago	1
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch  	1
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more	0
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when i'm not wearing it	0
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular	1
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby	1
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see	0
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe  nice ambiance clean friendly staff	1
it quit working after i'd used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset i've ever owned	1
i wouldn't return	0
overall i wasn't very impressed with noca	0
this movie is also revealing  	1
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing	1
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed	1
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  	0
needless to say i won't be going back anytime soon	0
the script is horrendously stupid  	0
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white lowbudget original  	1
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough	0
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means	0
my first visit to hiro was a delight	1
best i've found so far  i've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using	1
never got it	0
definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness  	1
after two i felt disgusting	0
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service	0
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1
the food wasn't good	0
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate	0
pretty piece of junk	0
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family  	1
unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening	0
it's very attractive and appears to be of good quality	1
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish	1
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for	0
now this dish was quite flavourful	1
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	1
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr  	1
very little music or anything to speak of  	0
definitely worth checking out  	1
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead	1
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  	0
all three broke within two months of use	0
will be back again	1
timely shipment and quality product	1
the football scenes at the end were perplexing  	0
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldn't produce my receipt i was out of luck	0
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection	1
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today  	1
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever  	0
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was  	1
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them	0
all in all i think it was a good investment	1
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it	1
strike 2 who wants to be rushed	0
there was nothing believable about it at all  	0
food was good service was good prices were good	1
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth  	1
the food was excellent and service was very good	1
we definately enjoyed ourselves	1
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no	0
great charger	1
it looked like a wonderful story  	1
total brunch fail	0
even worse than ticker  	0
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking	0
not tasty and the texture was just nasty	0
disappointed with battery	0
1 it works  2 it is comfortable	1
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor	0
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of	1
the service was poor and thats being nice	0
definitely a turn off for me  i doubt i'll be back unless someone else is buying	0
left very frustrated	0
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad	0
the chefs were friendly and did a good job	1
they work about 2 weeks then break	0
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320	0
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time	1
my friend did not like his bloody mary	0
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  	0
generous portions and great taste	1
poor quality and service	0
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea	0
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom	0
waitress was sweet and funny	1
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed  	0
this movie is so awesome  	1
overall this movie was cheap trash  	0
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet	0
this movie is terrible  	0
very bad experience	0

and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc  	0
