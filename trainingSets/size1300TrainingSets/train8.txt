the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem  	1
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards  	0

soyo technology sucks	0
as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening  	0
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism  	1

con spotty service	0
the suspense builders were good  just cross the line from g to pg  	1
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting  	0

the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood	1
weird vibe from owners	0
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard  	1

started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters  	0
then the film just dropped the ball  	0
delicious	1
excellent phone	1
and the accents are absolutely abysmal  	0
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone	0

its the best headset i have used	1
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine  	1

i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product	0
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting	1
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman	1
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture  	0
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great	1
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it	0
everything was good and tasty	1
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off	0
that's a huge design flaw unless i'm not using it correctly which i don't think is the case	0
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and i took a good two hours to fully recover  	0
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear	0

when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions  	1
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
they will customize your order any way you'd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it	1
they do not care about the consumer one bit	0
someone shouldve invented this sooner	1
earbud piece breaks easily	0
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief  	0
wow what a bad film  	0
as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it's frightening  	1

i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  	0
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear	0
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off	0
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going  	1

similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late	0
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized  	1

this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably  	0
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode  	0
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before  	1
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious	1
do not purchase this phone	0
i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk  	0

their research and development division obviously knows what they're doing	1
worst customer service ever	0
what the hell kind of crap is that  	0
everything is appalling  	0

i got home to see the driest damn wings ever	0
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good	1
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar	1
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management	0

the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either	0
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing  	0
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection	1
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing	0
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill  	1
again no plot at all  	0

i don't think you will be disappointed  	1
now the burgers aren't as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless	0

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake	0
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food	0
all three broke within two months of use	0
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 	1
it didn't work people can not hear me when i talk	0
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	0
excellent phone	1

con spotty service	0
hitchcock is a great director  	1
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc	0

good price	1
product is exactly as described	1
great for ipods too	1
interesting decor	1
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food	0
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation	0

nicest chinese restaurant i've been in a while	1
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear	0
definitely a turn off for me  i doubt i'll be back unless someone else is buying	0
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams  	1
you get what you pay for i guess	0
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom  	0
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff	1
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews	1
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse  	1
i love their fries and their beans	1
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk	0

but i definitely would not eat here again	0
it's a sad movie but very good  	1
prosgood camera  very nice pictures  also has cool styles like black and white and more	1
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here  	1
i consider this theft	0
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  	0
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid	1
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service	1
the dialogue is atrocious  	0
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this	0
and none of the tones is acceptable	0
the concert sequences just sucked  	0
we will not be coming back	0
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting  	0

they refuse to refund or replace	0
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors	1
the food is very good for your typical bar food	1
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense  	0
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i'm not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer  	0
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint	0
service was fantastic	1
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see	0
great service and food	1
good food  good service 	1

they have great dinners	1
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for	0
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job	0
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too	0
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history  	1

pretty awesome place	1
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
great product fast shipping	1
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding	1
but it is entertaining nonetheless  	1
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible	0
it also had a new problem	0
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  	1
definitely not worth the 3 i paid	0
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits	0
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier	1
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  	0
nice design and quality	1
i advise everyone do not be fooled	0
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked	1
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	0
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving  	0
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well	1
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen	0
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell  	0
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
they dropped more than the ball	0
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you	0
ample portions and good prices	1

it's very attractive and appears to be of good quality	1
i usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight  doesn't mess up my hair	1

one of the worst shows of all time  	0
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way	0

the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork	0
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu	1
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested	1
top line don't waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes  	0
unfortunately it did not work	0
there is nothing authentic about this place	0
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap  	0
if you simply want a small flip phone  look elsewhere as the extra bells  whistles are mediocre	0
it's a great place and i highly recommend it	1
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  	0

piece of trash	0
absolutely great	1
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles  	1
this if the first movie i've given a 10 to in years  	1

paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal	0
again lame  	0
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone	0
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well  	1
i still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones we just obviously don't share enough dna to copy the design over to humans	0
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed	1
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today	0
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet	1
the sides are delish  mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn  beateous	1
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid  	0
my phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand	1

the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected	1
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show  	1
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom	0
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices	1
the very idea of it was lame  take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie  	0
this is a beautiful phone	1
a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing  	1
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage  	1

he was terrible	0

all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul	1
the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite  	0
and quite honestly often its not very good  	0
all in all i can assure you i'll be back	1
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time	1

i didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort	0

 but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies  	0

i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there  letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him  	1
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
the only downside is the service	0
graphics is far from the best part of the game  	0
it was so funny  	1
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few  	1
