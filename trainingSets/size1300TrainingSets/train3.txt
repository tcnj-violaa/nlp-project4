this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way  	1
good price	1
omit watching this  	0
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive	1
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here  	0
it worked very well	1
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting  	1
worthwhile	1
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle  	1
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman	1
the burrittos blah	0
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed	0

i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it  	1
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf  	0
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking  	1
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again  	1
iam very pleased with my purchase	1
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all	0
buy a different phone  but not this	0
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant	0
this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon	0
some highlights  great quality nigiri here	1

verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data	0
it is shameful  	0
cute quaint simple honest	1
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service	1
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella the dead  	1
there's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts  	1
it's close to my house it's lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food	1
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  	1
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management	0
really awful  	0
and quite honestly often its not very good  	0
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films  	1
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent  	1
a fly was in my apple juice a fly	0
the film lacks any real scares or tension  some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least  i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself  	0
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver	1
terrible management	0
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda	0
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast  	1
buttons are too small	0
ryan's bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i won't be revisiting	0

she carries the movie well  	1
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good	1
extremely tasty	1
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end	1
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing  	0
worthwhile	1
thanks good a movie like this was done and released  	1
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next  	1
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas	0
will be back again	1
this phone might well be the worst i've ever had in any brand	0
it's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema  	1
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again	1
the service here is fair at best	0
the script is a big flawed mess  	0
the inside is really quite nice and very clean	1
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off	0
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work	0
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable  	0
food was good service was good prices were good	1
will order from them again	1
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section	1
if there is a wind it is completely useless	0
i gave it 5 stars then and i'm giving it 5 stars now	1
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  	1
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe  nice ambiance clean friendly staff	1
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever	0
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film  	1

it also had a new problem	0
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself  	1
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch  	1
very windresistant	1
excellent product	1
fast service	1
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing	1
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio  so very delightful	1
definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness  	1
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards  	0
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens	0
happy so far	1
 don't waste your time  	0
i still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones we just obviously don't share enough dna to copy the design over to humans	0
waste of money	0
today is the second time i've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good	1
the accompanied software is almost brilliant	1
i don't know what the big deal is about this place but i won't be back ya'all	0
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it	0
being a 90's child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons  	1
but the service was beyond bad	0
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far	1

all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes  	0
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it  	1
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it	0
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i won't be back here because it is a convenient location	0
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place	0
i got food poisoning here at the buffet	0
it was forced like everything in this movie  	0
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion  	1
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways	1
the waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us	0
i was not impressed by this product	0
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists  	1
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone	1
a fantastic neighborhood gem 	1
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone	0
i got food poisoning here at the buffet	0
i love this bluetooth	1

finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor	0
i don't like this nokia either	0
the result is a film that just don't look right  	0
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced	0
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon	0
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters  	0
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while	0
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything  	1
i was very impressed with the price of the cases	1
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction  	0
the service here leaves a lot to be desired	0
it has been a winner for us	1
yes it's that bad  	0
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device	0
i'm probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it	0
i'll give this film 10 out of 10  	1
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets  	1
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat	1
my friend did not like his bloody mary	0
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat	0
yes it's shiny on front side  and i love it	1
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died	0
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use	1

i am a fan of his  this movie sucked really bad  	0
the burrittos blah	0
everything was gross	0
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone	0
the block was amazing	1
it has all the features i want	1
battery life is also great	1
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it	1
the service was meh	0
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesn't understand where he is what he is doing and why  	1
it's like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
it looked like a wonderful story  	1
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  	1
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more	0
avoid at any and all costs  	0
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide	1
basically the service was very bad	0
wow very spicy but delicious	1
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
i hate writing bad reviews about films  especially those in which i really like the star  but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it  	0
not good enough for the price	0
the case is great and works fine with the 680	1
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film  	1
not too screamy not to masculine but just right  	1
works as described	1
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product	1
here's where the movie really pied me off  	0
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time	1
wow loved this place	1
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert	0
so good i am going to have to review this place twice  once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night	1
then the film just dropped the ball  	0
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place	0
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great	1
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount	0
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying  	0
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good	1
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end	1
i never come again	0
better than you'd expect	1
is pretty funny  	1
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly	0
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks  	0
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty	1
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for	0
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say  it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things   	0
awful  	0
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years  	1
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show  	0
if you don't find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone	0
very disappointing	0
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this	0
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk  	0
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds	0
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing	0
it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen  	1
it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how childlike the company is	0
hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood  	1
omit watching this  	0
interesting decor	1
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest  	0
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history  	1
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude	1
we waited for forty five minutes in vain	0
four stars for the food  the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe  still letting us in to eat 	1
do not buy do not buyit sucks	0
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen  	0
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake  	0
will not be back	0
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them  	0
for that it's worth checking out  	1
but even the talented carrell can't save this  	0
what a waste	0
lots of holes in the script  	0
actually the graphics were good at the time  	1
don't make the same mistake that i did and please don't buy this phone	0

we will not be coming back	0
wasted two hours  	0
very very fun chef	1
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets  	1
very windresistant	1
this one just fails to create any real suspense  	0
totally believable  	1
don't waste your money	0
also the story and acting were weak  	0
awful service	0
perfect for the ps3	1
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable	1
i would not recommend this place	0
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done  	0
we definately enjoyed ourselves	1
2 thumbs up	1
i advise everyone do not be fooled	0
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one	1
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation  	0
not tasty and the texture was just nasty	0
this short film certainly pulls no punches  	0
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family	1
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord  	1
i am sorry i made this purchase	0
great audio	1
this show is made for americans  it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere  	0
it was awesome	1
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use	0
the acting sucked  	0
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more	0
best headset ever	1
how stupid is that	0
it's a feelgood film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema  	1
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast	1
i don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea	1
the service was terrible food was mediocre	0
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor  	1
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise	0
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems	1
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me	0
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear	0
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well	0
very friendly staff	1
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk  	0
good transmit audio	1
my girlfriend's veal was very bad	0
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there	0

stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it	1
interesting decor	1
the waitress and manager are so friendly	1
the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim  	1
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear	0
they know how to make them here	1
the acting sucked  	0
after two i felt disgusting	0
this place was such a nice surprise	1
will not be back	0
i won't be back	0
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately	0
and i just love the colors	1
it really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down	0
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits	0
this is such a fun and funny movie  	1
the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right  	0
still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow  	1
the atmosphere here is fun	1
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcit's all wrong  	0
price is good too	1
we'll never go again	0
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means	0
very bad experience	0
bt50 battery junk	0
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again	0
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food	0
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  	1
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction  	0
good protection and does not make phone too bulky	1
i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence  	0
good protection and does not make phone too bulky	1
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
all in all i'd expected a better consumer experience from motorola	0
blue ant is easy to use	1
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7	1

piece of trash	0

it doesn't make you look cool	0
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1
we are sending it back	0
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism  	1
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying	0
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years  	1

eclectic selection	1

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic  	1

but i thought his acting was skilled  	1
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged	0

it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella the dead  	1
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  	0
this place receives stars for their appetizers	1
his costars don't fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted  	0

always a great time at dos gringos	1
long whiny and pointless  	0
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping	0
this is infuriating	0
nice docking station for home or work	1
 the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	1

great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts	1
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight	1
also the story and acting were weak  	0

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds	0
what a big waste of time	0

the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing  	0
definitely not worth the 3 i paid	0

great brunch spot	1
great hands free device	1
i took back my money and got outta there	0
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr  	1

all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop	0

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe  	1
it's fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable	1

you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action  	0
weird vibe from owners	0
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with	0
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree	1

star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series  	0
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life  	0
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere	0
all in all i'm quite satisfied with this purchase	1
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	0
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality	1

a week later after i activated it it suddenly died	0
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff	1

long whiny and pointless  	0
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service	1

not enough volume	0
weird vibe from owners	0
the case is great and works fine with the 680	1

we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting	0
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them	1
would recommend this item	1
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf  	0
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before	1
worst thai ever	0
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season  	0
if you haven't gone here go now	1
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs  	0
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve	1
but this movie really got to me  	1
definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness  	1
i'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place	0
the construction of the headsets is poor	0
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles	0

i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics	1
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to	1

buttons are too small	0
the best phone in market 	1
lasted one day and then blew up	0
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table	0

director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next  	1
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch	1
regrettably the film fails  	0

he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miner's daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire  	1
excellent cast story line performances  	1
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes	1
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try  	1
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note i'd love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones  	1
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look	0
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach	0
the buttons for on and off are bad	0
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration	0
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this	0

but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold  	1
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander  	1
10 out of 10 stars  	1
i will come back here every time i'm in vegas	1

it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk	0
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing  	0
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad  	0
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	1
it does everything the description said it would	1
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core  	0
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience  	0
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head  	1
i won't be back	0
poor product	0
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee	0
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with  	1
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives  	1
when i'm on this side of town this will definitely be a spot i'll hit up again	1
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it	1

 but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies  	0
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs  	0
extremely tasty	1
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently	0

weird vibe from owners	0
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in	0

i don't like this nokia either	0
the directing seems too pretentious  	0

this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored	1
i advise everyone do not be fooled	0

unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect	0
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop  	1
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before  	1
it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy  	0
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices	0

very disappointing	0
don't waste your  on this one	0
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad	0

i'm very disappointed with my decision	0
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot	1
the kids are very cool too  	1
it has all the features i want	1

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it	0
there's really nothing bad i can say about this headset	0
plus with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job  	1
i've had better bagels from the grocery store	0

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop	0

it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  	1
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible	0
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives  	1
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series  	0
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
very clear quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset	1
the only downside is the service	0
i love their fries and their beans	1
the warm beer didn't help	0
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking	0
i was not happy with this item	0
in a word it is embarrassing  	0
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head  	1
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white lowbudget original  	1
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh  	0
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time	1
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected	1

the character developments also lacked in depth  	0
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing	1
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film  	0
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul	1
overall a delight  	1
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  	1
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything  	1
this may be the only bad film he ever made  	0
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was  	1
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use	0
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it	0
the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim  	1
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning  	0
this is an extraordinary film  	1
uncomfortable in the ear don't use with lg vx9900 env	0
