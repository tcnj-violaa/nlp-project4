i love this place	1
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again  	1
it has been a winner for us	1
those burgers were amazing	1
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem	0
what the hell kind of crap is that  	0
good prices	1
and the sound quality is great	1
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom	0
very bad experience	0
the portion was huge	1
love this product	1
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section	1
don't be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010  	1
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather	0
i will never forget it now  	1
pretty awesome place	1
i have recommended it to friends  	1
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible	0
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality	1
if you want a real scare rent this one  	1
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse  	0
definitely a turn off for me  i doubt i'll be back unless someone else is buying	0
i love the camera it's really pretty good quality	1
the menu is always changing food quality is going down  service is extremely slow	0
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures  	0
definitely worth checking out  	1
we waited for forty five minutes in vain	0
the selection was probably the worst i've seen in vegasthere was none	0
my headset works just peachykeen	1
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty	1
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough	0
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad  	0
won't go back	0
i enjoyed it  	1
i was hoping for more	0
raw and sublimely moving  	1
spoilers whatever else can or can't be said about it surface is superbly crafted  	1
i don't know what the big deal is about this place but i won't be back ya'all	0
i've had better bagels from the grocery store	0
doesn't hold charge	0
now you know why i gave it a 10  	1
good case excellent value	1
then as if i hadn't wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check	0
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america  	0
food was below average	0
a great touch	1
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic  	0
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more	0
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years  	1
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before	1
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving  	0
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe  poor hummh  	0
i can't wait to go back	1
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him	1
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look	0
the staff are great the ambiance is great	1
you could drive a semi truck into these holes  	0
we loved the place	1
i gave it a 10  	1
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value	1
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age  	1
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off	0
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent	1
glad i didn't pay to see it  	0
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon	0
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had	1
great price too	1
great for using with your home stereo	1
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  	0
i just saw this film and i recommend it  	1
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line  	1
the fries were great too	1
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is  	1
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  	0
great earpiece	1
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film  	1
i've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me	1
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it  	1
very disappointed	0
i was deeply impressed with the character he played  	1
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal	1
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse	0
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions	1
great choice	1
the food was great as always compliments to the chef	1
spend your money and time some place else	0
both do good jobs and are quite amusing  	1
the only downside is the service	0
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue  	1
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad	0
these are fabulous	1
10 out of 10 stars  	1
excellent product	1
delicious	1
no real improvement	0
very unreliable service from tmobile 	0
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened	0
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying  	0
i have read other's reviews here but i haven't had any problem with it	1
as for the service i thought it was good	1
i do think tom hanks is a good actor  	1
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous  	1
protects the phone on all sides	1
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area	1
appetite instantly gone	0
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative	1
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack	0
the pizza selections are good	1
regrettably the film fails  	0
i don't have to be an accountant to know i'm getting screwed	0
the fries were great too	1
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped	0
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no	0
couldn't use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas	0
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place	1
excellent cast story line performances  	1
it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy  	0
nice design and quality	1
extremely tasty	1
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it	0
don't buy this product  it fails	0
works good	1
not tasty and the texture was just nasty	0
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating  	1
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love  	1
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process  	1
highly entertaining at all angles  	1
 in fact it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself  	1
once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place	1
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them	0
so far so good	1
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art  	1
even billy bob couldn't rise above the script which was worse  	0
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe  poor hummh  	0
i didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort	0
the service was not up to par either	0
but it picked up speed and got right to the point  	1
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings	0
funny clever hip  just like pray's previous film hype  	1
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left	0
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume	0
battery has no life	0
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed	0
don't make the same mistake that i did and please don't buy this phone	0
then the film just dropped the ball  	0
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective  	1
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it  	1
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today  	1
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	1
this is hands down the best phone i've ever had	1
the service was meh	0
the jerky camera movements were also annoying  	0
sauce was tasteless	0
the worst was the salmon sashimi	0
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table	1
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review	0
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone	0
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways	1
 both the hot  sour  the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars	1
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists  	1
has been working great	1
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud	1
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far	1
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying	0
i won't be back	0
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf  	0
my gyro was basically lettuce only	0
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did	0
my sister has one also and she loves it	1
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here	0
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy  	1
avoid at any and all costs  	0
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse  	0
i'd advise anyone to go and see it  	1
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving  	0
never got it	0
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking	0
avoid this one if you can	0
i'll give this film 10 out of 10  	1
once your food arrives it's meh	0
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and i took a good two hours to fully recover  	0
the film looks cheap and bland  	0
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips	1
they have great dinners	1
crisp and clear	1
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws  	0
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 	1
i'm probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it	0
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review	0
never got it	0
the range is very decent i've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues	1
if you simply want a small flip phone  look elsewhere as the extra bells  whistles are mediocre	0
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy  	1
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it	0
my first visit to hiro was a delight	1
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing	1
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 	0
you get what you pay for i guess	0
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it	0
the acting as you'd expect from this cast is top notch  	1
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic	1
everything from acting to cinematography was solid  	1
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side	0
food quality has been horrible	0
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item	1
service is also cute	1
it wasn't busy at all and now we know why	0
the food is about on par with denny's which is to say not good at all	0
1010  	1
third the cheese on my friend's burger was cold	0
lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age  	0
and there wasn't a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here  	1
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint	0
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch  	1
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep  	0
light weight i hardly notice it is there	1
definitely a turn off for me  i doubt i'll be back unless someone else is buying	0
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame  	1
the service was outshining  i definitely recommend the halibut	1
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  	0
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie  	0
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts	1
an awesome new look for fall 2000	1
wow very spicy but delicious	1
this isn't a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment	1
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	0
poorly contstruct hinge	0
it is a really good show to watch  	1
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging	1
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this	0
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better	1
the acting is beyond abysmal  	0
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable  	1
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing	1
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor	1
if the food isn't bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world's worstannoying drunk people	0
the plantains were the worst i've ever tasted	0
if it were possible to give them zero stars they'd have it	0
four stars for the food  the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe  still letting us in to eat 	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  	1
i'm a bit disappointed	0
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene  	0
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever	0
delicious and i will absolutely be back	1
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated	1
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad  	0
their daily specials are always a hit with my group	1
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not	0
it does everything the description said it would	1
it is worth the drive	1
my rating just 3 out of 10  	0
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria	1
worth every penny	1
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably  	0
here's where the movie really pied me off  	0
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me	1
very good lunch spot	1
everything about this movie is stupid  	0
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom	0
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast	1
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder  	0
sauce was tasteless	0
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see	0
crostini that came with the salad was stale	0
i could not recommend these more	0
lousy product	0
the shrimp tender and moist	1
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it	0
a pretty good product	1
it was packed	0
don't waste your money	0
we'll never go again	0
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell  	0
attempting artiness with black  white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed  became even more ridiculous  as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent  	0
not enough volume	0
the pizza selections are good	1
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent  	1
those burgers were amazing	1
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1
 anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot  	1
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly	1
food was great and so was the serivce	1
lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age  	0
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather	0
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear	0
good prices	1
if you simply want a small flip phone  look elsewhere as the extra bells  whistles are mediocre	0
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems	0
i will not be eating there again	0
very good quality though	1
my sister has one also and she loves it	1
cumbersome design	0
i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone  	0
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy  	1
totally believable  	1
all i have to say is the food was amazing	1
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast  	1
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care  	1
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem	0
i cannot make calls at certain places	0
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in	0
filmiing was less expansive  	0
very little music or anything to speak of  	0
great pizza and salads	1
they refuse to refund or replace	0
i won't try going back there even if it's empty	0
incredible	1
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcit's all wrong  	0
don't waste your money and time	0
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside	1
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow	1
this one just fails to create any real suspense  	0
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast	1
i don't know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories  	1
excellent sound quality	1
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public  	0
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper	1
it was way over fried	0
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  	0
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference  	1
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then i'm lost	0
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it  	0
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is  	0
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  	0
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago	1
thank you for such great service	1
my friend loved the salmon tartar	1
the presentation of the food was awful	0
delicious	1
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small	0
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest  	0
the construction of the headsets is poor	0
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives  	1
spend your money elsewhere	0
sooooo good	1
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price	1
it was so boring  	0
it is worth the drive	1
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time	1
lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age  	0
great phone	1
earbud piece breaks easily	0
the story itself is just predictable and lazy  	0
it was also the right balance of war and love  	1
interesting decor	1
but i thought his acting was skilled  	1
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20  left in the morning	0
it will drive you barking mad  	0
this short film certainly pulls no punches  	0
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family	1
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service	1
i advise you to look out for it  	1
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint	0
the phone is sturdy and waterproof	1
overall a delight  	1
made very sturdy	1
2 thumbs up	1
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow	1
this movie is also revealing  	1
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture  	0
it's like a really sexy party in your mouth where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party	1
fantastic food	1
in short don't bother with this movie  	0
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious	1
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1
perfect for the ps3	1
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine  	1
yeah the movie pretty much sucked  	0
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced	0
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar	0
dont waste your money	0
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
amazon sucks	0
well im satisfied	1
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it	0
this phone is pretty sturdy and i've never had any large problems with it	1
even worse than ticker  	0
don't buy it	0
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320	0
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep  	0
very easy to use	1
too politically correct  	0
like the other reviewer said you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again	0
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it	0
love it great armband	1
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for	0
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare	0
made very sturdy	1
we won't be going back anytime soon	0
excellent bluetooth headset	1
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving  	0
don't bother  go to the store	0
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten	0
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs  	1
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list	0
the bt headset was such a disapoinment	0
the only thing i wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as i don't like it puréed	0
they were goldencrispy and delicious	1
disappointed with battery	0
pretty good beer selection too	1
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse  	1
bt50 battery junk	0
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out  	0
it worked very well	1
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up  	1
after 20 minutes wait i got a table	0
great audio	1
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special	1
works good	1
but tiny toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created  	1
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack	0
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary	0
terrible service	0
i went on motorola's website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again	0
and none of the tones is acceptable	0
i literally vomited while watching this film  	0
magical help	1
good quality	1
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with	1
one of the worst shows of all time  	0
provides good protection and looks classy too	1
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  	1
food was really good and i got full petty fast	1
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it  	1
so don't go there if you are looking for good food	0
i was very impressed with the price of the cases	1
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place	1
not recommended  	0
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed	0
 but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies  	0
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles  	1
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying	0
our server was super nice and checked on us many times	1
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great	0
it's an empty hollow shell of a movie  	0
very good product well made	1
highly entertaining at all angles  	1
never going back	0
this movie totally grates on my nerves  	0
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world	1
protects the phone on all sides	1
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed	0
it is very comfortable on the ear	1
fantastic earphones	1
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid  	0
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables	0
horrible  don't waste your time and money	0
it also had a new problem	0
never had anything to complain about here	1
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing	0
do not waste your money here	0
she's poised and amazing  	1
also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design  costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar  	1
it is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it	1
she's poised and amazing  	1
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder  	0
what a mistake that was	0
we will not be coming back	0
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast  	0
doesn't last long	0
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since	0
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality	1
ambience is perfect	1
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc	1
there were too many close ups  	0
up there with the best of melville  	1
horrible horrible protector	0
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear	0
very unreliable service from tmobile 	0
nice spicy and tender	1
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i don't expect any problems	1
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines  	0
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no	0
great product	1
the sides are delish  mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn  beateous	1
battery has no life	0
the plug did not work very well	0
very friendly staff	1

good prices	1
good case excellent value	1
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently	0
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them  	0

but this understated film leaves a lasting impression  	1
if you look for authentic thai food go else where	0
i'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place	0
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat	0
very clear quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset	1
the ambiance was incredible	1
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized  	1
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  	1

the instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used	0
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm	0
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process  	1
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives  	1
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop  	1
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again	0
we enjoy their pizza and brunch	1
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm	0

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	1
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love	1
if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time  	0

after all the rave reviews i couldn't wait to eat herewhat a disappointment	0

i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since	0
great phone	1
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art  	1
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up	0
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse  	1
easy to pair with my samsung cell	1
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	1
the movie seemed a little slow at first  	0
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone	0
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree	1

it's like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices	1

this is an unbelievable bargain	1
this is an excellent film  	1
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0

secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
service was fantastic	1
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds	0
it's a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver  	1
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles  	1
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat	0
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game  	1
i dressed up to be treated so rudely	0
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse  	0
this is actually a very smart movie  	1

there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit  	0
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with	1
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place	1
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun	1
thoroughly disappointed	0
also the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player	0
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register	0
i give it 2 thumbs down	0
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1
definitely not worth the 3 i paid	0
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network	0
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable  	0
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic	1
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole  	1
con spotty service	0

i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar	0
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation  	0
maybe it's just their vegetarian fare but i've been twice and i thought it was average at best	0
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it  	0
the soundtrack sucked  	0
it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time  	1
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here	0
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear	0
i did not expect this to be so good	1
i just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine	0
the portion was huge	1
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back  	0
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous	1
being a 90's child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons  	1
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few  	1
pretty awesome place	1
nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes  	0
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends  	1
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great	1
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger	0
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly	1
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service	1
sending it back	0
the waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us	0

poor talk time performance	0

the patio seating was very comfortable	1
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone	0
it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to quality for if they did we'd have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess  	0
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden	0
this is definitely one of the bad ones  	0
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try	1
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely  	0
i gave it 5 stars then and i'm giving it 5 stars now	1
crust is not good	0
both great	1
great headset very impressed  h500	1
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  	1

the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless	0
everyone is treated equally special	1

special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon  	1
 both the hot  sour  the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars	1
it wasn't busy either also the building was freezing cold	0
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game  	1
the mic is great	1
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them	0
what a waste of time	0
lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly won't allow  	0
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up  	1
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed  	0
great charger	1
this place is like chipotle but better	1
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  	0
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	1

if the food isn't bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world's worstannoying drunk people	0

but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr  	1

my 810 score is mostly for the plot  	1

lange had become a great actress  	1
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	0
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting	1
