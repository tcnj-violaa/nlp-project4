i can assure you that you won't be disappointed	1
simple lightweight and great fit	1
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale  	1
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked	0

i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious	1
he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money  	0
if you don't find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone	0
this is definitely one of the bad ones  	0
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi	1
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal	1
so good i am going to have to review this place twice  once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night	1
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either	0

great phone	1
if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance  	0
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action  	0
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there	1

on the up side their cafe serves really good food	1
the block was amazing	1
either way it sucks  	0

a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man  	0
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended	1
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular	1
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone	1
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
lots of holes in the script  	0
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference  	1
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds	0
the cast is always entertaining as usual  	1

the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end  	1
very clear quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset	1

the service was a bit lacking	0
customer service was terrible	0
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself  	1
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love  	1
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days	0
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying	0
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  	0
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow	1
it was so funny  	1
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt  	1
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company	0

beautiful styling though	1
it's too bad the food is so damn generic	0
unfortunately 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain  	0
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently	0

but this movie is definitely a below average rent  	0
and those baby owls were adorable  	1
 but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies  	0
watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show  	0
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case	1
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant	0
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today	0

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly  	1
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical  	0
the mic is great	1
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script  	0
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough	0
it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films  	0
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends	1
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience  	0
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever	0
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes	0
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed	0
the food amazing	1
another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model	0

ample portions and good prices	1
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier	1

three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen  	1
and the sound quality is great	1
i was so insulted	0
what a great double cheeseburger	1
he's a national treasure  	1
the service here leaves a lot to be desired	0

the service was outshining  i definitely recommend the halibut	1

to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  	0
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcit's all wrong  	0

i rather enjoyed it  	1
good product good seller	1
disappointed	0
mic doesn't work	0
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine  	1
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips	1
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations  	1
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp	1
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  	1
my phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand	1
plus it's only 8 bucks	1
it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'  	0
this movie totally grates on my nerves  	0
terrible phone holder	0
excellent sound quality	1

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale  	1
i also had to taste my mom's multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious	1
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone	0
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low	0
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does	0
as for the service i'm a fan because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks	1
anne heche was utterly convincing  	1
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last	0

all in all i think it was a good investment	1

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor	0
don't bother  go to the store	0
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixar's cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories  	1
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen  	0
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist  	0
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever	0

i can't use this case because the smell is disgusting	0
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho	1
very tough and very short on flavor	0

the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	1
the veggitarian platter is out of this world	1
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it  	1
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too	1
very slow at seating even with reservation	0
the script iswas there a script  	0

blue ant is easy to use	1

if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one	0
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food	0
 i love it  	1
don't waste your money	0
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella the dead  	1
i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk  	0
i liked the way dustin hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son  	1
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	0
third the cheese on my friend's burger was cold	0
good audio quality	1
good prices	1
generally it just lacked imagination  	0
it is an insane game  	1

i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child  	1
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged	0
definitely worth checking out  	1
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it  	1
i found the product to be easy to set up and use	1
 both the hot  sour  the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars	1
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it	1
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby	1
they dropped more than the ball	0
service is also cute	1
it's a piece of crap	0
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world	1
good case excellent value	1
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up	1
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good	0
works great	1
happy so far	1
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet	0
disappointed	0

restaurant is always full but never a wait	1
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
terrible product and waste of money	0
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch	1
lasted one day and then blew up	0
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that i've tried so far and they're all good	1
i would recommend this	1
keep up the good work amazon	1
go rent it  	1
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated	1
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  	1
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it	0
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america  	0
i like armand assante  my cable company's summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again  	1
very slow at seating even with reservation	0
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	0
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor	0
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby	1
buy it play it enjoy it love it  	1
2 thumbs up	1
 down the drain because of a weak snap	0
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted	1
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity  	0
blue ant is easy to use	1
restaurant is always full but never a wait	1

i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes	1
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable	1
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best	1
fans of the genre will be in heaven  	1
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside	1
food was really good and i got full petty fast	1
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well	0
always a great time at dos gringos	1
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs	0
the only place good for this film is in the garbage  	0
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits	0
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star	0
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf  	0
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because there's nothing lower  	0
prosgood camera  very nice pictures  also has cool styles like black and white and more	1
i started this review with two stars but i'm editing it to give it only one	0
the goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what flavor	1
it just blew  	0
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp	1

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace  	0

jabra ear gels r the best	1
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life  	0
this film has no redeeming features  	0
i would highly recommend this	1
on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  	0
nice docking station for home or work	1
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way  	1
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger	0

it's a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect  	1
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that	1
great value	1
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast	1
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection	1
painful on the ear	0

great time  family dinner on a sunday night	1
i'm still infatuated with this phone	1
i dressed up to be treated so rudely	0
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest  	0

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper	1
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway	0

every thing on phone work perfectly she like it	1
service is also cute	1
but i definitely would not eat here again	0
in a word it is embarrassing  	0

the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho	1
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film  	0
the food was terrible	0
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters  	0
once your food arrives it's meh	0

brilliant  	1
camera color balance is awful	0

the football scenes at the end were perplexing  	0
this place is amazing	1
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage	0
sending it back	0
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds	0
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going  	1
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  	1
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldn't have even been created  	0
cool phone	1
once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place	1

the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right  	0
good show samsung	1
magical help	1
this one just fails to create any real suspense  	0
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else  	0
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty  	0
a film not easily forgotten  	1
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick  	0
i'm probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it	0
always a great time at dos gringos	1
battery is holding up well	1

plus it's only 8 bucks	1
sending it back	0

defective crap	0
after one bite i was hooked	1
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  	0
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen  	1
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player	0

the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night  	1
it felt too light and tinny	0
there's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before	0
i would not recommend this place	0
not good by any stretch of the imagination	0
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer	0
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon  	1
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other  	1
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but i'm not inspired to go back	0
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters  	1
yet i enjoy watching it  	1
i would highly recommend this product	1
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small	0
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem  	1

bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing	0

i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone	1
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us	0
it's a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver  	1
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea	0
the least said about the acting the better  	0
it's an empty hollow shell of a movie  	0
i like armand assante  my cable company's summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again  	1
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful	1
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  	1

the movie showed a lot of florida at it's best made it look very appealing  	1
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor	0
my friend did not like his bloody mary	0
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse  	1
food was so gooodd	1
 comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously	1
but then they came back cold	0
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid	1
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome	0
the burger had absolutely no flavor  the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor	0

the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite  	0
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films  	1
setup went very smoothly	1
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed  	0

it really created a unique feeling though  	1
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad	0

those burgers were amazing	1
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think we'll just go to ninja sushi next time	0
i'll give this film 10 out of 10  	1
pretty awesome place	1
