all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10  	1
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little  	1
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard  	0
often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings  	0
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy  but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly  	0
i wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time though  	0
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived  	1
it is a true classic  	1
the problem was the script  	0
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time  	1
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip  	1
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful  	1
the directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good  	0
some applause should be given to the prelude however  	1
a great film by a great director  	1
however this didn't make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie  	0
all in all a great disappointment  	0
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq  	0
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination  	0
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly  	0
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film  	0
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things  	0
the story is beyond stupid  	0
the lead man is charismafree  	0
highly unrecommended  	0
if this premise sound stupid that's because it is  	0
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them  	1
the film is way too long  	0
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch  	0
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes  	0
the flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy  	0
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films  	0
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick  	0
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made  	1
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie  	0
there is a lot of beautiful places  	1
the acting was bad  	0
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me  	1
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art  	1
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous  	1
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played  	1
and i really did find them funny  	1
for those that haven't seen it don't waste your time  	0
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film  	0
barney is definitely super de duper  	1
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie  	0

the new characters weren't all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who  	0
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual  a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget  	1
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer  	1
 what makes this story different are the terrific production values  faultless photography composition and editing  the terrific casting  the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy  and vivid history  	1
this is high adventure at its best  	1
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful  	1
i couldn't take them seriously  	0
her role was played well  	1
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing 'ive never had this feeling before'i totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid  	1
110  and only because there is no setting for 010  	0
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible  	0
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words  	0
the directing is sloppy at best  	0
see it  	1
the rest of the cast also play well  	1
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life  	0
everything about it is just bad  	0
final word this show is a real torture  	0
there are so many problems i dont know where to start  	0
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast  everyone played their parts really well  	1
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes  	0
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifa's character  	0
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luv's diaper commercial is completely unconvincing  	0
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece  	1
so badwellit's just bad  	0
the movie is terribly boring in places  	0
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so i'll give credit where credit's duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool  	1
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing  	0
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer  	0
not recommended  	0
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period  	0
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie  	0
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles  	0
there still are good actors around  	1
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil  	1
unless you're just out to visually collect all extant films of austen's work you can skip this one  	0
all of the main players are mesmerising  	1
i can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection  	0
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema  	1
highly recommended a  	1
 very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time  	0
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes  	0
how awful she is  	0
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors  	0
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character  	1
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong  	0
that's how i'd describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film  	0
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title  	1
 some great music and terrific scenery  	1
nothing new there  	0
what on earth is irons doing in this film  	0
emily watson's character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything  	1
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruise's attempt  	1
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film  	1
and it was boring  	0
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself  	1
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court  	1
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i've seen  	1
predictable but not a bad watch  	1
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part  	1
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd  	1
avoid at all costs  	0
the worst one of the series  	0
this film offers many delights and surprises  	1
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable  	1
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasn't  	0
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid  	0
i don't know what happened in season five what a mess  	0
the puppets look really cheesy  not in a good way like in the puppet master 80's flicks  	0
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets  	0

otherwise don't even waste your time on this  	0

not easy to watch  	0
the movie is not completely perfect but 'titta di girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie  	1
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful  	1
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think you'll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you  	1
simply beautiful  	1
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz  	1
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful  	1
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses  	1
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting  	0
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film  	1
i keep watching it over and over  	1
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off  	0
service was very prompt	1
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal	1
overall i like this place a lot	1
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick	0
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse	1
a great way to finish a great	1
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well	1
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old	0
